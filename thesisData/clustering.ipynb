In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled “Un chin de veneno”, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled “Álbum rojo”, “Flamboyan”, “Con sus flores y sus vainas”, “Cotidiano”, “Artistas por la paz”, “Inspiraciones”, “Tu corazón” y “Alma de Barrio”.

      "Joseph Migliucci was the fourth generation of the venerable Migliucci family of chefs and restaurateurs who opened Mario’s Pizzeria in 1919 at 2342 Arthur Avenue in the Little Italy section of The Bronx. Joseph was the son of Mario and Rose, grandson of Giuseppe and great grandson of Scolastica whom collectively guided Mario’s from a small pizzeria to a renowned Italian eatery patronized and beloved by multiple generations of customers. His parents urged Joseph to higher education and a professional career. While studying engineering in college he decided on a different course and left to join the family business. Joseph brought boundless energy, superior technical and mechanical skills and love for people, food and life to the restaurant. He learned all facets of the business: cooking, prepping, cleaning, repairing, purchasing, serving, hosting, marketing and finances. Trained by Mario and uncle Clemente, Joseph became both a world class chef and master pizza maker of Mario’s signature thin crust Neapolitan style pies for which it remains famous. Generations of customers fortunate enough to eat a Joseph made pie attest that no one did it better. Far beyond preparing meals, Joseph touched countless individuals though his acts of love, kindness and friendship. Employees struggling with all kinds of life’s obstacles, customers seeking comfort or advice, fellow businessmen needing assistance, friends needing help - or bail – and the ‘down and out’ fighting addiction needing guidance or a second chance, found it from Joseph. With a gentle heart, large frame and even bigger hands, he provided compassion to his fellow man so many times that the touching expressions of tribute arising from his sudden departure are far too many to list. Joseph displayed his generosity to the end. In his final days of life at the hospital as his condition deteriorated, he chose his fate and told the night nurse “…give the ventilator to somebody else who needs it…” Even in these trying times, true to his nature, he managed to touch the lives of those around him. He died of COVID-19.\n",

During that time he participated in securing the city of Metz, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. For his service, he received seven medals, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star.  He was later awarded the French Legion of Honor as well. After the war, Gasparre returned to Astoria, where he started a family and took a job with the U.S. Postal Service. In 1964, he took a second job with the New York Mets at the recently-opened Shea Stadium and during his 55 years as an usher, witnessed two World Series victories, the legendary concert by the Beatles, and a visit from the Pope. Although he grew up a Yankees fan (and was once even quizzed on baseball and the Yankees to prove he was an American soldier), he became one of the most familiar, beloved faces at Shea Stadium and Citi Field.')"
