Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5. Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts. In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman\\'s cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister. Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason-Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet\\'s trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister\\'s family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York. By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves. With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman”, published in 1869 were a great financial help. In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis\\' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died of pneumonia. She was 93 years old. Harriet Tubman was not afraid to fight for the rights of African-Americans. Her story is one of dedication and inspiration. During her lifetime Harriet was honored by many people. In 1897, her bravery even inspired Queen Victoria to award her a silver medal. ',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Amadou Diallo was born on September 2, 1975 in the village of Sinoe, Liberia, West Africa. He was the first of four children born to Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo. Amadou has one sister, Laouratou, and two brothers, Ibrahima and Abdul Salaam. Because his father, Saikou, was a businessman, Amadou traveled throughout much of his childhood living in Togo, Guinea, the homeland of his parents, Bangkok and Singapore.Amadou grew up with a love of reading, music, dancing and sports. Once in the United States, he became an avid basketball fan, in particular, of Michael Jordan. In fact, Amadou was such a true Michael Jordan fan that he shifted from a Bulls fan to a Knicks fan when Jordan had decided to retire.Amadou had a passion for school and attended some of the finest schools in the world, including The French International School, London\\'s Cambridge University, The British Consulate College in Thailand and the Asian Institute of Microsoft. It was Amadou\\'s dream to one day enroll in school in the United States. At twenty, he decided to come to America to continue his computer education and he wanted to do it on his own. In September of 1996, he decided to come to New York to start a business with his cousin. His father, Saikou, was reluctant at first but later relented after he was reassured by relatives that Amadou would be taken care of. Upon his arrival in New York, he first worked as a delivery man but later became a street peddler selling gloves, socks and video tapes in Manhattan on 14th Street. He worked six days a week, 12 hours a day. However, his dream to pursue his education in America continued. A young man from Senegal who met Amadou in New York fondly recalls the times he and Amadou would sit talking for hours about school. After class, he\\'d stop by Amadou\\'s stand where Amadou would always have a cold bottle of apple juice waiting for him. He\\'d take his usual seat while Amadou would run down his usual questions; \"So tell me, how was school in America today? How do you feel about being in the classroom?\" He\\'d get so excited just listening and, at the end of every conversation, he\\'d say, \"You know, I\\'m really going to go to school here someday.\"A spiritual person, when Amadou was about 18 years old, he began to focus and collect books on his religion, studying the Koran and praying five times a day in the Muslim tradition. When the family came to collect Amadou\\'s belongings after his death, they found solace in what they discovered. Among the many things they found were writings where Amadou had begun to research the prophets. He had written the names of all the prophets along with the dates of their birth. He had highlighted passages in the Koran that spoke about the dialogues between Christians and Muslims. Amadou was on a spiritual journey.Amadou was killed on February 4, 1999, after midnight, by four New York City police officers from the Street Crime Unit. Amadou had come home from work to his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview Section of the Bronx and decided to go back out to get something to eat. Upon his return, he encountered the police officers who ultimately fired a fuselage of 41 shots, 19 of which riddled his body. Amadou died in the vestibule of his apartment building.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Bobby Bello was born and raised in Bay Ridge. The youngest of nine children, he was born on June 4, 1927 to Tony and Netti Bello. He attended P.S. 105, Pershing Junior High School and graduated from Fort Hamilton High School in 1945. After high school he served in the Air Force for two years. Bobby was a member of the Local #40 Iron Works union for the next forty years. He worked on various projects in the New York City area, among them the Twin Towers and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. This brought him a sense of great pride and joy, especially when connecting his beloved Bay Ridge with his new home Staten Island.In 1952 at a Father Strype fund raising dance Bob met and later fell in love with Margaret Moakler. Two years later on October 16, 1954 in the upper church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Bob and Margie were married by her brother Father Michael Moakler. Together they had five children, Bonnie, Robert, Phillip, Stephen, and Toniann.In 1973, Bob was laid up suffering from a back injury. At that time he encouraged Maggie to go to college. Four years later she graduated with honors from Richmond College. Later, again with his encouragement, she would also acquire her Masters Degree from Saint John’s University. In the year 2000 she retired from Saint Patrick’s School after teaching the second grade for twenty years.Bob’s chosen sport was football. As a little boy on 7th avenue and 59th street, his dream was to be a good football player. He’d often reminiscence about his days at the “Dust Bowl” field. How he took old newspapers, rolled them together tightly, wrapped them with string or rubber bands and call that his football. He would take his “ball” to the Dust Bowl, throw the ball down the field, run back and catch it. Bob would be there for hours learning to “run and catch”. Since Fort Hamilton did not have a football team, Bob played with the local sand lot teams, such as The Hawks, The Imps, and the Bay Ridge Celtics where he was both a player and a coach. One year he played semi-pro football for the Indians. The last game he played was on his endeared Shore Road Football field, he was 38 years old.Bob’s coaching abilities were becoming well known in Bay Ridge. In 1955, Bob, together with the youth officer Ray Rupelli, of the 64th precinct located then on the corner of 86th street and 5th avenue, began the “Police Athletic League” (P.A.L.), which till this day still flourishes under the title of 68th precinct Youth Council. At the time he was also coaching in the Pop Warner Football League. The games were played on their home field at Shore Road and 79th street. Ironically enough, this field at 79th street and Shore Road is now the home field of the Xaverian Clippers Football team which is coached by Dom Laurendi, who was one of Bob’s early ball players. He coached and nurtured thousands of young boys through out those years, and one outstanding young man was the New York Jets John Dockery. Over the years John never forgot his “coach,” Bobby Bello. Later, Bob opened a sporting goods store on 77th street and 5th avenue and many of his “kids”, now mature young men, would stop by to recall the good times they had with the P.A.L. John Dockery was one of these “kids.” Bob was proud to know that his Bay Ridge local boy had won an athletic scholarship to Harvard University. Dockery also won a Superbowl Ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shortly afterwards, Joe Namath and Dockery joined forces and began the “Joe Namath and John Dockery Football Camp”. Bob was one of the first coaches to join the camp. Further more, he was a part of that camp up to the time of his death, some 27 years in all.Bob’s world of coaching took him down many paths and to many fields as he coached New York Police Department Football teams, numerous high school teams such as, Tilden, Monsignor Farrell, and Tottenville High School. In 1992 the New York Finest were the champs in the Policeman’s Benevolent Association Fun City Bowl in Florida, and in 1997, the Tottenville “pirates” were the New York City P.S.A.L. Champions. On both Occasions he received a ring in his name, a dream come true. He was very proud of these rings and “His” boys. With all the devotion and hard work that he gave to his coaching, one would think that coaching was his first love. But this was not the case.Bobby Bello’s first and heartfelt love belonged to his family. His wife Margie, their five children, eight grandchildren, his brothers and sisters, and their children. He felt proud to have coached his sons Robert, Phillip, and Stephen, his nephews Michael, Robert, Joseph, and later his son Joseph the III, and then his grandsons Robert and Sean. This for Bob was a joyful accomplishment. Bobby Bello’s football days started alone on the “Dust Bowl” field, but his accomplishments, his achievements, and his adulation began on the fields of Shore Road. Bobby Bello died on February 16, 1999.Bobby was not only a great football player and coach, but he was an exceptional, outstanding and magnificent man. A man whose name will give honor and due respect to this field.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Father Michael McGivney was born in Waterbury on August 12, 1852. The oldest of thirteen children of Irish immigrants Patrick and Mary (Lynch) McGivney, Michael learned early about sorrow, the harsh grip of poverty, love and faith, and family fortitude. Six of his siblings died in infancy or childhood. At the age of 13 he left school to work in a spoon-making department of a brass factory to provide a few more dollars for family survival. When he reached the age of sixteen, he traveled to Quebec, Canada with his Waterbury pastor and registered at the French-run College of St. Hyacinthe. With the priesthood clearly in mind, he worked hard on subjects that would prepare him to apply for seminary admission. He studied two additional years at Our Lady of Angels Seminary in Niagra Falls, New York. He then moved to Montreal to attend seminary classes at the Jesuit-run St. Mary\\'s College. When his father died in June of 1873, he went home for the funeral concerned for his family\\'s welfare, lingering awhile in Waterbury. Then, at the request of the bishop of Hartford, he entered St. Mary\\'s Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. On December 22, 1877, he was ordained in Baltimore\\'s historic Cathedral of the Assumption by Archbishop (later Cardinal) James Gibbons. A few days later, he said his first Mass at Immaculate Conception Church in Waterbury. Father McGivney began his priestly ministry on Christmas Day in 1877 as curate at St. Mary\\'s Church in New Haven. It was the city\\'s first parish. A new stone church had been built, after the old one burned, on one of New Haven\\'s finest residential Streets, Hillhouse Avenue. There was neighborhood objection which even the New York Times noted in 1879, under the headline: \"How An Aristocratic Avenue Was Blemished By A Roman Church Edifice.\" So Father McGivney\\'s priestly ministry in New Haven began with tension and defensiveness among the working-class Irish families he served. Father McGivney worked closely with the young people of St. Mary\\'s parish, holding catechism classes and organizing a total abstinence society to fight alcoholism. In 1881 he began to explore with various laymen the idea of a Catholic, fraternal benefit society. In an era when parish clubs and fraternal societies had wide popular appeal, the young priest felt there should be some way to strengthen religious faith and at the same time provide for the financial needs of families overwhelmed by illness or death of the breadwinner. He discussed this concept with Bishop Lawrence McMahon of Hartford, and received his approval. He traveled to Boston to talk with the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters, and traveled to Brooklyn to consult the Catholic Benevolent Legion. He met with other priests of the diocese. Wherever he could, he sought information that would help the Catholic laymen to organize themselves into a benefit society. William Geary, one of the Order\\'s charter members, said that at the first council meeting in 1882, he was \"acclaimed as founder by 24 men with hearts full of joy and thanksgiving, recognizing that without his optimism, his will to succeed, his counsel and advice they would have failed.\" Father McGivney had suggested Sons of Columbus as a name for the Order. This would bind Catholicism and Americanism together through the faith and bold vision of the New World\\'s discoverer. The word \"knights\" replaced \"sons\" because key members of the organizing group who were Irish-born Civil War veterans felt it would help to apply a noble ritual in support of the emerging cause of Catholic civil liberty. In the first public reference to the Order on February 8, 1882, the New Haven Morning Journal and Courier said the Knights of Columbus\\' initial meeting had been held the night before. On March 29, the Connecticut legislature granted a charter to the Knights of Columbus, formally establishing it as a legal corporation. The Order\\'s principles in 1882 were \"Unity\" and \"Charity.\" The concepts of \"Fraternity\" and \"Patriotism\" were added later. Each of these ideals played a major role in ceremonials from the beginning. The Columbus-linked themes, says historian Christopher J. Kauffman, \"reverberated with pride in the American promise of liberty, equality and opportunity.\" In April of 1882, Father McGivney, with the permission of Bishop McMahon, wrote to all the pastors of the Diocese of Hartford. The Order\\'s primary objective, he wrote, was to dissuade Catholics from joining secret societies by providing them better advantages at times of death or sickness. He urged each pastor to exert influence \"in the formation of a Council in your parish.\" Father McGivney personally installed the first officers of San Salvador Council No. 1 in New Haven, in May of 1882. By May 1883, Council No. 2 had been instituted in Meriden, Connecticut and Bishop McMahon, so impressed with the organization, became a member of Council No. 11 in 1884, and served it as council chaplain. By the end of 1885, there were 31 councils in Connecticut. Father McGivney\\'s dedication to the Order was evidenced in trips he made to all parts of Connecticut and in handwritten correspondence—little of which survives—about K of C business. At St. Mary\\'s, despite all this, he remained the energetic curate with constant concern for every parishioner\\'s problems. Then in November of 1884, he was named pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston, Connecticut, a factory town 10 miles from his hometown. It was a factory parish, heavily in debt, serving working-class parishioners with few resources beyond their faith. With prayerful acceptance, Father McGivney put his seven years at St. Mary\\'s behind him. His New Haven parishioners, in a testimonial resolution elaborately superimposed on the drawing of a chalice and host, declared that despite burdens and afflictions, his courtesy, his kindness and the purity of his life had \"secured the love and confidence of the people of St. Mary\\'s, which will follow him in every future field of labor.\" In six subsequent years at St. Thomas, he wrestled with the church debt and built the same close ties of devotion and charitable concern he had developed in New Haven. He continued, as well, to serve as supreme chaplain, personally involved in helping the Order to extend its membership into Rhode Island. Later, from 1901 to 1939, his younger brothers, Msgrs. Patrick and John J. McGivney, served the Order as supreme chaplains. Never robust in health, Father McGivney was suddenly stricken with a serious case of pneumonia in January 1890. It hung on. Various treatments for consumptive illness were tried, but his decline persisted. The young priest lost physical strength just as the Order he founded was moving toward new vitality. On August 14, 1890, Father Michael J. McGivney died at the age of 38. In his 13 brief, busy years as a priest, Father McGivney\\'s piety and compassion had won the love of those he served as curate and pastor. His Christian inspiration, leadership and administrative drive had brought him the loyalty and affection of thousands who knew him as the founder of the Knights of Columbus',\n",

As a young man his family, which consisted of his parents, a sister, Ester and brothers David and Kenneth, moved to 19th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, in Brooklyn. “Bill” attended Public School 10 graduating in1945. At age 19 he married Angela LaDuca Thomas, on September 26, 1952. The marriage produced two sons, David and William Junior.Bill Thomas’ first job was with Caputo Bakeries on Court Street. He later worked as a route man, salesman and driver for Drakes Cakes Company, Inc. In 1962 Bill and Angela purchased a brownstone home at 459 14th Street. Ten years later, in 1972, he founded the 14th Street Block Association and remained its president for the rest of his life. During this period he became a very active, and a very hands-on, community leader and activist. He was elected to be a Judicial Delegate for the Kings County Democratic Party and, in 1985, was asked to become Chairman of the Board of the 17th Street Block Association, a tenants advocate organization which he helped to found. In February 1990, Mr. Thomas was a founding member of the United Coalition to Save and Preserve the 14th Infantry Regiment Armory Conservancy Inc., an organization that he chaired from 1996 to 1998. Bill also served as Campaign Treasurer for the Honorable Bernard Fuchs’ election to the Supreme Court of the State of New York in 1986 and 1992.In 1996, Bill Thomas, along with his good friend and colleague Alfred P. Raffo and others, fought side by side for the return of “Iron Mike”, a WWI Statue of a 14th Infantry Regiment “Doughboy”, to its traditional pedestal in front of the Armory’s main entrance. Later in 1996, he worked with Department of Transportation (DOT) officers to have a traffic light installed, at the corner of 14th Street and Eighth Avenue to protect local residents.

Hawkins and his friends walked onto the ambushers' block unaware that local residents were waiting to attack any group of black youths they saw. After the murder of Hawkins, police said that he had not in any way been involved with the neighborhood girl whom the killers believed Hawkins was dating.

He was a gifted athlete and an even bigger sports fan, and from childhood filled his days with basketball, football, and baseball. Over the years, Joe took his passion for youth sports, determination, teamwork, hard-earned victories, and community to Spellman High School, where he coached both junior varsity and varsity football, leading his team to two A Division City Championships in 2006 and 2008 and joining the Catholic High School Football League Board of Governors. In 2018, he was inducted into the Spellman High School Hall of Fame, honored for his years of youth mentorship, the sense of family he created among his players, and the absolute conviction he cultivated that every single one of them was capable of and worthy of excellence.  In 2015, he returned to the Warriors, and served three more years as League President. During this time, he evolved the league with a transition to technology and connectivity, while maintaining Warrior traditions and values. He led the Warriors until 2018, during which he also initiated a free youth training clinic, open to all children of the community. Each spring, more than 100 children participate in the free program that was dedicated to ‘taking children back outdoors for fitness and fun. In 2019, he was honored by the Morris Park Community Association for his lifelong commitment as a Bronxite, demonstrated through his level of involvement with Little League baseball and football in the Bronx. Youth sports was his passion, and made him a local celebrity in the neighborhood. On 9/11, he was at the World Trade Center performing search and rescue efforts with his team from Con Ed, and continued for weeks with16-hour shifts. In 2006, Joe was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. In 2008, the family had organized its first Team DeSimone for the Lymphoma Research Foundation’s Lymphomathon. Over the next 12 years the family, and the dear friends who are part of that family, have helped raise over $100,000 to find a cure in Joe’s honor, and in 2018 were recognized with the LRF’s Marnie Gordon Founder’s Award.',\n",

Neighbors used garden hoses, a fire extinguisher and blankets to treat burn victims and put out fires. Three fire trucks, two engines and a rescue squad responded to the crash. Ultimately, the efforts of the community and the first responders were not enough to combat the impact of the crash and the subsequent heat and fire caused by the gasoline used to power the large planes.

His professional life began in 1972, with the authorship of La Casita (The Little House), which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas. This piece became such a great success that it inspired the budding author to launch his career as a performer and composer, work that kept him busy for the rest of his life. In the 1970s, his dissatisfaction with domestic politics and economic policies in the Dominican Republic, added to increasing international turmoil, inspired him to write songs with social and political content as his aesthetic compass. Mr. Víctor also took part in the movement opposed to the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and he began to write protest songs. As a young man he traveled the country as part of youth groups protesting the government while receiving an education in local rhythms. Between 1973 and 1978, he founded and led the group Nueva Fortuna, with which he traveled all over the country. In 1978, he created the group Flamboyán, through which he projected his music as a sample of rhythmic intermixing. For five years he shared the stage with the most important figures of the Latin American song and performed in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Italy. Victor Victor studied the musical roots of merengue and bachata, recreated the genre and enriched it. Successes such as “Mesita de noche”, “Ando buscando un amor” y “Así es mi amor” were made with simplicity and beautiful metaphors and have been performed by leading Dominican and foreign vocalists. In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled “Un chin de veneno”, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled “Álbum rojo”, “Flamboyan”, “Con sus flores y sus vainas”, “Cotidiano”, “Artistas por la paz”, “Inspiraciones”, “Tu corazón” y “Alma de Barrio”. In 2007, he recorded the social-themed album “Verde y negro” as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the Dominican Republic. Victor died of COVID-19 at a hospital in Santo Domingo at age 71. The artist was awarded the Awards: Premios A Lo Nuestro, Aplauso 92, Ronda, ACE, Aplauso 98, ASCAP and ONDA. Victor Victor remains a beloved and influential artist for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans in New York City.',\n",

His other accomplishments in the South Bronx include the opening of Rainey Garden in 1984, and in 1989, the opening of Demera/Santiago Garden on Avenue St. John and Kelly Street. In 1990, the Miranda Theater was inaugurated and gave life to the 52 Latin Jazz Concert Series. Since then, over 200 concerts have been performed there, showcasing the talents of Johnny Pacheco, Conjunto Clasico, Tito Nieves, Manny Oquendo and Libre, and nine-time Grammy-award winner, Eddie Palmieri, among others.

Both in the State Assembly or Congress, Solarz was always mindful of local issues, calling himself “Representative Pothole.” In 1980, he was the first American public official to visit North Korea since the end of the Korean War to meet with Kim II-sung. He chaired the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was remembered for his leadership in the Philippines by pushing the Reagan administration to distance itself from the Marcos government. He led the congressional movement for democracy in the Philippines and held highly publicized hearings to prove that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos had looted the Philippine treasury of millions of dollars to buy real estate in the United States. After President Ferdinand Marcos left the Philippines, Solarz worked closely with Benigno S. Aquino’s widow and president, Corazon, who dubbed Solarz the Lafayette of the Philippines.In 1990,he introduced a bill denying a sports team that leaves a city the right to sue for trademark infringement. The bill grew out of a suit filed by the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Brooklyn Dodgers Sports Bar and Restaurant in Brooklyn.

He was appointed by President Bill Clinton as chairman of the United States government funded Central Asian American Enterprise Fund to bring private development to Central Asia and co-founded the International Crisis Group, a private, non-governmental organization designed to strengthen the international community’s ability to anticipate and prevent man-made crises.

In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. \"I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it.\" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies. The \\'60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America\\'s cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown\\'s Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground. His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown\\'s Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, \"which is still finding Claude Browns,\" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared. Claude Brown\\'s story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the \"cycle of poverty,\" they said, for the \"urban underclass,\" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope. Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone\\'s payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land. ',\n",

Under the leadership of Pastor Barnes the ministry has achieved and continues to strive to do the following:1.A daycare center was established to aid working families with the care of their children. It included early childhood development as well as a nursery. Over 5000 students have been influenced during their formative years, many going on to college and higher endeavors.2.Through out the years, the Ministry has provided employment to over 200 persons living in the community. Reverend Barnes personally helped people obtain jobs while he served as Assistant Housing Commissioner during the late Mayor John V. Lindsey’s administration from 1966 to 1973. 3.Mt. Gilead B.C. was originally established as a mission, and this work is still going on. Our soup kitchen serves thousands of hot meals to needy men, women and children each year. The ministry also has a food pantry and a clothing give away.4.Under the leadership of Reverend Randolph Barnes, fervent preaching, soul winning and evangelistic outreach continues to go on. This year will be our 4th year of street outreach, taking the life saving message of Jesus Christ to the street in English and Spanish.5.Pastor Barnes ordained a host of Reverends, Ministers and Deacons and did his best to equip the church of the future by training officers to carry out the work of the ministry.Reverend Randolph Barnes, Jr. died on November 6, 2002.

She fought to have accessible transportation services for local senior citizens, to have a mobile van to provide Metro tickets sold in local areas, to require builders in the low areas have valid permits before putting in foundations that would ruin the costal water plane. When the battle for a new South Richmond Plan became about she joined forces with another Community Activist, Lorraine Sorge of the Taxpayers Association, and together the two organizations mobilized enough community support to have the plan adopted, thus saving the wet lands and open spaces from rapid over development.Until her death in September 2002, Mary was still engaged in fighting for the community by organizing the residents to protest the plans for a 181 unit housing development without adequate protection for the homeowners living in the low planes of Great Kills coastal area.',\n",

These mentors have a dramatic, positive affect on their “littles’” lives, particularly in regards to school, self-esteem, relationships with family and friends, and resistance to drug use and crime. On average, these relationships last three years, while their friendships often last a lifetime.The agency’s success is due to its commitment to its on-on-one mentoring programs that provide long-term caring and support under the supervision and guidance of a professional social worker.While the Traditional Mentoring Program continues, reaching more boys and girls than ever, Coulter’s dedication to creative, new solutions also thrives here. BBBSNYC offers unique programs, tailored to fit the needs of diverse groups-corporate employees, single parents, or new Americans. And BBBSNYC’s Center for Training enables it to function as a “teaching hospital”, performing research and propagating the best practices of youth mentoring to nonprofits far and wide. BBSNYC is considered the forerunner for mentoring programs nationwide and today there are 450 Big Brother Big Sisters Agencies and an additional 50,000 organizations that mentor.

After serving in the Army Signal Corps in Panama during World War II, he went to art school in Mexico under the G.I. Bill. Returning to Puerto Rico in the early 1950s, he became a member of Generación del Cincuenta, a group of young artists dedicated to forging an aesthetic identity for the island. He was a founder of Taller Boricua, a workshop and art collective started in East Harlem in 1970, and was also influential in the establishment of El Museo del Barrio in that neighborhood. His work was the subject of a major retrospective at the museum in 2003. His art, which can be seen on posters throughout Old San Juan, presents scenes of daily life in Puerto Rico such as work, dance, music and festivals in bright, Fauvist colors. His paintings, including landscapes, interiors and portraits, are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the , the  and the Galería Nacional in Puerto Rico. In 2003, he was given a lifetime achievement award by the National Arts Club in New York City.

Despite having no official training as a preservationist, Maynard charged on, and succeeded in reintroducing the country to a once-thriving Brooklyn community that included New York’s first black police officer and first black female physician.  She was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 29, 1928, and graduated from Empire State College of the State University of New York.  In 1968, four small cottages were discovered on the edge of Crown Heights that are believed to be all that remained of Weeksville, which dates to 1838.  Through efforts led by Maynard, schoolchildren and a small group of volunteers, the houses were designated a city landmark in 1970 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  She was the founding member of the Weeksville Society, where as president and later executive director she oversaw several renovations to the houses over the years.  In 2004, the most extensive of the renovations were completed. In 2012, the Weeksville houses were opened to the public following their $3 million renovation. ',\n",

Demand for the original product was strong and today those solid body electric instruments are collectibles whose market value continues to increase.

He was an Olympic and World Champion boxer, who was crowned “Sportsman of the Century” by Sports Illustrated in 1999.  He won the World Heavyweight Boxing championship three times, and won the North American Boxing Federation championship as well as an Olympic gold medal.  He was born in Louisville, Kentucky and was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., but later changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam and subsequently converted to Sunni Islam in 1975.  In Louisville, October 29, 1960, he won his first professional fight winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker, who was the police chief of Fayetteville, West Virginia.  He went on to later retire with a boxing record of 61 bouts with 56 wins (37 KOs), 5 losses (1 Kos) and 0 draws fighting some of the most exciting bouts in boxing history.  In 1964, Ali failed the Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were subpar, however, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified 1A.  He refused to serve in the United States Army during the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector.  This and his affiliation with the Nation of Islam made him a controversial and popular figure in history.  Near the end of 1967, he was stripped of his title by the professional boxing commission and would not be allowed to fight professionally for more than three years. He was also convicted for refusing induction into the army and sentenced to five years in prison.   In 1970, he was allowed to fight again, and in late 1971 the Supreme Court reversed his conviction.  He went on to fight Joe Frazer and George Foreman in what is arguably considered some of the best fights in boxing history.   He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the early 1980s causing his motor functions to decline.  Despite his disability, he remained a beloved and active public figure.  In 1985, he served as a guest referee at the inaugural WrestleMania event.  In 1987, he was selected by the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution to personify the vitality of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights in various high profile activities and rode on a float at the 1988 Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the United States Constitution’s 200th birthday commemoration.  He received a Spirit of America Award calling him the most recognized American in the world and in 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.  In 1999, he received a special one-off award from the BBC at its annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ceremony, which was the BBC Sports Personality of the Century Award. He was also named “Kentucky Athlete of the Century” by the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in ceremonies at the Galt House East.  In 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony on and the prestigious Otto Hahn peace medal in Gold of the United Nations Association of Germany in Berlin for his work with the US civil rights movement and the United Nations.  On November 19, 2005, the $60 million non-profit Muhammad Ali Center opened in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth.  After his retirement from boxing, he was devoted to humanitarian endeavors around the world lending his name and presence to hunger and poverty relief, supporting education efforts of all kinds, promoting adoption and encouraging people to respect and better understand one another.  It is estimated that he has helped to provide more than 22 million meals to feed the hungry.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'King Stephen was born Vajk, in 977 AD, son of Grand Prince Geza of the Magyars. Dedicated to the welfare of his people and committed to the strengthening of his people through intellectual and moral means, Geza invited Christian missionaries of the reform Benedictines from Cluny, France into his realm. As an example to his people, he had missionaries instruct his son and baptize him under the name Istvan or Stephen.\\nStephen succeeded his father as Grand Prince of the Magyars in 997. Recognizing the energetic and responsible leadership of this young ruler on the eastern flank of Europe, Pope Sylvester II in 1000 granted Stephen the title of King of Hungary and sent papal emissaries to him with a crown symbolic of the new title and a double barred archbishop’s cross indicative of the establishment of a separate church organization for the newly independent nation. Since then, this crown and cross have become the radical confirmation of legitimate constitutional authority in Hungary and a rallying symbol of national identity and strength during the occupations of the Turks, the Austrians, the Nazis and the Soviets. The coronation of Stephen also focused Hungary toward the west.\\nStephen organized the secular and religious life of Hungary in a manner which endures, with slight change, to the present. He invited foreigners, especially those who were refugees from oppression, into Hungary so that they could each enrich it with their customs, languages, and creativity. In this fashion, Stephen anticipated the “melting pot” concept of society, as we know it today. In his personal life, Stephen lived as an outstanding example of a husband and a father to such a extent that he and his son Prince Imre, or Emeric, were recognized as Catholic saints, and his wife, Queen Gesilla, was recognized as a Catholic blessed. Outstanding for his service to the poor and destitute and stalwart in using his political power for the defense of the powerless, Stephen shortly before he died, officially offered his crown to God as the only true ruler. \\nDecember 20, 2000 marked the millennium of the coronation of Stephen as the first monarch of the Magyars (Hungarians). In recognition of this event, Pastors of the Hungarian churches of New York City have requested the permanent renaming of East 82nd Street, between York Avenue and Third Avenue, to “King Stephen of Hungary Way”.  This will include the East 82nd Street, between First and York Avenues, location of St. Stephen’s Hungarian Church.\\n',\n",

Gardner, Sr. was born to Moses and Carrie Gardner, on February 26, 1907, in New Smyrna, Florida. He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University.  Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University’s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary.  \\nIn 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl.  During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain.\\nAfter completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia.  In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York.  During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built.\\nReverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc.  Also among Reverend Gardner’s accomplishments was his selection as “Distinguished Institute Leader and Preacher” at Virginia Union University and Bishop College and his selection in 1973 as Alumni of the Year by Virginia Union University.  Reverend Gardner served as a member of the 250th Anniversary Committee of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia and published several articles on the Negro in Colonial times.\\nReverend Doctor William E. Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974.  He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named “Rev.

       "  'reason': 'Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter were a father and son team that helped to guide the fortunes of the Trinity Lutheran Church at the Stapleton community of Staten Island for more than 71 years.\\nReverend Frederic Sutter, one of the first graduates of Wagner College (Rochester, NY), became pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in 1907. Shortly after his arrival, the congregation decided that a new church was needed. The responsibility of building the new church fell to Reverend Sutter. He guided the project into construction in 1913 and in 1914, the present edifice, an imposing Gothic structure of yellow brick located on Beach Street, was dedicated. Trinity Lutheran Church grew under Reverend Sutter’s leadership and by 1929 was believed to have 3,000 baptized members and 1100 communing members and probably had the largest Protestant membership on Staten Island at that time. \\nNear the end of World War I, Reverend Sutter’s alma mater, Wagner College in Rochester, New York, reached out to him for help finding a new location for the school. Through his efforts, Wagner College relocated to Grymes Hill on Staten Island. Reverend Frederic Sutter was succeeded as pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in 1964 by his son, Reverend Carl Sutter, who had served under him for more than three decades.\\nRev. Carl Sutter, known as “Pastor Carl”, was born in Hudson, New York and was brought to Staten Island, at seven months of age, when his father accepted the pastorate at Trinity Lutheran Church. He attended Public Schools 14 and 15 in Tompkinsville and Wagner Preparatory School. In 1929 he received a Bachelor’s degree in liberal arts from Wagner College. Carl Sutter then took a job on Wall Street while continuing his education at New York University Graduate School. After the stock market crashed later that year, Carl Sutter decided to leave the business world and follow in his father’s footsteps in the ministry. He enrolled at Princeton University and, a year later, transferred to his father’s alma mater, Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. Soon after his ordination in 1933 he returned to Staten Island to join his father at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was to spend his entire career as a clergyman there. In 1936, Dr. Sutter married his childhood sweetheart, the former Eleanor Koehler of Stapleton and moved to Emerson Hill.\\nRev. Sutter was considered by many as a pioneer in improving community relations on Staten Island. He helped organize the Booker T. Washington Center during World War II to look after the needs of some 7000 African-American troops stationed in Stapleton who were denied access to the local United Service Organization (USO). Also during the War, Rev. Sutter, who was fluent in German, served as the chaplain for German prisoners of war at the former Halloran Hospital. He often played a key role in the Staten Island Interfaith relations, having served as chairman of the building committee for The nondenominational Bethel Community Church in Tompkinsville. Also, for several years, he orchestrated a series of Holy Week Services that brought together members of Protestant and Catholic churches in the Stapleton/Tompkinsville community.  Rev. Sutter served as president of the Staten Island Council of Churches and held a key position in what is now the Metropolitan Synod of the Lutheran Church of America. During the 1960’s, Rev. Sutter oversaw the construction of the $1,000,000 Trinity Lutheran School.  He delayed his retirement seven years, until 1978, to ensure that the debt on the school was paid in full.\\nReverend Carl Sutter died in October 1998 at the age of 91. He was survived by two sons, Frederic and Carl Richard, three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Staten Island County Clerk Mario J. Esposito, who served on the Wagner College Board of Trustees with Reverend Carl Sutter for 12 years, said in an interview that he considered Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter the “backbone” of the College.  “Both were friendly, community-minded.  They set the standards and the goals. They were men of integrity.”  In recognition of their contributions to Wagner College, Trinity Lutheran Church, the Borough of Staten Island and the City of New York, it is fitting that the northeast corner of Beach Street and St. Paul‘s Avenue, the site of Trinity Lutheran Church, be named “Rev. Frederic and Rev. Carl Sutter Corner” in their honor.\\n',\n",

With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.\\nAfter working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000.\\nAt the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey.

As a child, Mr. Candrilli was always active in sports, playing baseball for New Dorp High School, football in the New Dorp Teens Football League and caddying at the Richmond County Country Club, which brought out his love for golf. \\nOn October 22, 1942 Sal Candrilli enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served as a Combat Engineer in the 2nd Division, seeing action in Spain, the Mariana Islands and Okinawa. He was honorably discharged as a Corporal on December 8, 1945. After his discharge, Sal Candrilli worked for the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company and for Local 21, Staten Island before being hired by the New York City Department of Parks, where he retired after 35 years as a Mechanic Foreman in 1985.\\nHe met and married, Ethel Young on April 10, 1948 and they had four children, Donald, Richard, Jerome and Missey, which is why his “love affair” of approximately 30 years, with Little League Baseball started.  Sal Candrilli began his Little League “career” as a coach with the Island Chevies. He also served as field Commissioner, umpire, and later, president of the Staten Island Little League in Dongan Hills, for approximately 17 years. He continued for another 13 years as District 24 Administrator for the National Little League Headquarters, overseeing leagues on Staten Island and in Manhattan. During this time he led the fight against a measure that would have taxed Little Leagues for their real estate helping to form the Staten Island Athletic and Recreational Alliance.

In 1974, while president of the Staten Island Little League, he was profiled in the Staten Island Advance for his work in planning and preparing to host the National Regional Tournament at Hy Turkin field. In 1976, he was honored for “Outstanding Services to Staten Island Sports”, at the 11th annual Advance All-Star Dinner. In 1985 Mr. Candrilli decided to “retire” from Little League Baseball because, as he said,  “times have changed and it’s time for someone else to take over”, but also saying that, “I’ll always be around”.\\nOn September 20, 1996 Salvatore Candrilli died. He was survived by his wife, the former Ethel Young; his children, a sister, Ann Pinto, and four grandchildren. His participation in organized sports on Staten Island made a difference for many people, including his grandchildren, Christina and Peter Candrilli and Nicole and Jennifer Vitagliano, who actively play in many organized sports on Staten Island. They have inherited his sportsmanship, respect for others on and off the field, and his true feelings for all kinds of sports, always remembering that he would say “it doesn’t make a difference if you win or lose but it’s how you play the game”.

Also in 1981 he received the “Abe Nadelman Award for Outstanding Service” from Post #769 JWV (Mr. Nadelman was their first commander); Mr. Rapkin also received the “Man of the Year” award from the Bronx County Council of JWV; in 1984 he became the first recipient of Post #769’s “Murray Portnoy Memorial Award”; and in 1986 he was the Pelham Parkway Jewish Center’s “Man of the Year”.\\nHarold Rapkin died on October 23, 1997. He was survived by his wife, Grace, and a brother, Edwin. For his many years of devoted service to the Bronx Community, it is fitting that the westside of Paulding Avenue at its intersection with the Esplanade, where Harold Rapkin lived for many years, be called Harold Rapkin Plaza in his honor.\\n',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Juan Pablo Duarte, born in the city of Santo Domingo on January 26, 1813, is considered the “Founding Father of the Dominican Republic”. He was the son of a Spanish merchant and, as a teenager, he was sent to Spain to continue his studies. During this time he was greatly influenced by Catalonia’s “autonomous community” goals. When he returned to Santo Domingo in 1838, he found that young Dominicans were resentful of Haitian rule. The Haitian domination of eastern portion of the island of Hispaniola had begun in 1822. The political unification of Hispaniola brought liberation to the slaves, land reforms, and political rights for all the people living on the eastern part of the island. Haitian domination made the Dominican people recognize the importance of self-government and political participation. Haitian law recognized political participation but Dominicans were actually considered a minority with few rights.\\nIs was in this atmosphere that Juan Pablo Duarte created a secret society, called “La Trinitaria”, in 1838 so that the yearning for liberty and self-government could be further intensified. He developed a political underground movement that organized the youth of the most important cities of the eastern part of Hispaniola. To promote their goals they used flyers, “cantaletas” (serenades with songs that had political content), and presented dramas with political content through a cultural organization called “La Filantropica”. This organization was open to all, promoted cultural activities and was controlled by “La Trinitaria”. In 1843, La Trinitaria worked together with the “Reformista” movement from the western part of the island to overthrow Jean Pierre Boyer’s Regime. Though this did not end Haitian rule, the situation made it possible for the La Trinitaria movement to gain political strength and to work in the open during elections.\\nCharles Herard, the leader of the Reformista movement and successor to Boyer, understood and mistrusted the political goals of the Trinitaria. After he was elected president in 1843 Herard persecuted the “La Trinitaria” movement and Duarte was forced to escape to Curacaco while his closest collaborators went into hiding. However, the movement toward independence continued to grow even with Duarte in exile. On February 27, 1844 the forces for independence issued a proclamation declaring the freedom of the Dominican Republic. Duarte returned and he immediately took charge of the army. This situation was short lived, however, for another political group that also promoted annexation took over the government and jailed Duarte. He was sent into exile within a year.\\nDuarte retired to an isolated village in Venezuela and remained away from his country for twenty years. In 1861, Spain took over the Dominican Republic and made it a colony. War broke out in 1863 against Spanish rule and Duarte returned the following year to fight again for Dominican Independence. He was sent on a diplomatic mission by the provisional Dominican government to solicit funding for the war from neighboring countries. After independence was reestablished he returned to Venezuela. He died there in 1876, having devoted his entire life to the independence of the Dominican Republic. In recognition of his leadership in the independence movement of his country it is fitting that the northern side of West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway, in the heart of one of New York’s largest Dominican communities, be called “Juan Pablo Duarte Square.”  The naming of this “Square”, located at the end of the previously named “Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard”, will provide space to erect a monument to Duarte as a symbol of  “democracy and freedom”.\\n',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Jean-Jacques Dessalines is one of the founding fathers of Haiti, having taken charge of the Haitian Revolution to victory in defeating the French Napoleon Army in 1804.  Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776.   Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world.  More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present:  the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean.  By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname “the Tiger” for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794.  From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue.  \\nAfter Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue.  Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning.  By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation.\\nThe independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa.  Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter’s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America.  Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today’s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women.  Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed “Dessalines”; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (“La Dessalinienne”); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.\\n',\n",

His position at St. Barnabas, for example, allowed him to help a 6-month-old child fly from the Dominican Republic for delicate heart surgery. Father David Casella passed away on February 7, 1999 from a heart attack at 49 years old.  His short life positively impacted many other lives.  He achieved the goal of any simple parish priest by bringing many people to God; he was truly blessed and he blessed the communities and parishes he touched.',\n",

Upon graduating high school, John signed a professional baseball contract with a New York Giants minor league farm team,  but subsequent football injuries precluded a career in the major leagues.In 1958 John married Joan Pickens.  They lived in Gravesend until 1965 when they moved to Bergen Beach, Brooklyn.  They were parents to three children, John III, Richard and Deborah.  John went into the family business, “Malone and Sons Florist,” where he served as company president until his untimely death on June 24, 1991.Although injury prohibited John from continuing in his own baseball career, his dream flourished when he created a sports program for the children of Bergen Beach and all of Brooklyn.  In 1978, he began advocating for the youth of the community. With the assistance of the elected officials, civic associations and the community, additional ball fields on parkland adjacent to McGuire Park on Bergen Avenue were constructed.  John and other community volunteers gave hundreds of volunteer hours to build the complex.  In September 1981, John founded the Bergen Beach Youth Organization  (BBYO) and became its first President and Executive Director.Today, BBYO serves thousands of young people through baseball, softball, hockey, tennis, football, soccer and volleyball programs.  BBYO sponsors after-school and evening centers in ten local schools.

In June of 1997, Father Kull became Pastor, and just one week after his installation, the Church was destroyed by fire, which ultimately led to its complete restoration.

Jacob Safra was the proprietor of Banque de Credit National, successor to the business of Safra Freres, a merchant banking business that originated about 1840 in the Ottoman Empire.In 1948 Edmond was sent, along with an experienced banker, to Italy to consider diversification opportunities for the family.  The post war atmosphere was filled with opportunities for an energetic, entrepreneurial banker and Edmond created a precious metals trading business, the first of what was to become a long string of financial and banking successes.In 1952 Edmond was encouraged by his father to explore opportunities in the New World.  Having visited North and South America he decided to open a business in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Within a few years progress was so substantial that Edmund persuaded his father to move the rest of the family to Brazil.  The Brazilian business evolved into Banco Safra, which is now Brazil's fifth largest bank.  Today, Edmond’s two younger brothers privately own it.In 1956 Edmond opened the predecessor to Trade Development Bank in Geneva, Switzerland.  He wanted to meet the international financial and banking needs of middle eastern families which, like his own were moving from that troubled region. In 1983 Trade Development Bank was sold to the American Express Company for $550 million.In the early 1960's Edmond decided to complete the South American European banking triangle and applied for a national banking charter in New York City.  The charter was granted and Republic National Bank of New York was opened in January, 1996.  Its initial capital, which was slightly more than $10 million, was at the time the largest initial capitalization of a new bank in the history of the United States.  The ribbon was cut by Robert Kennedy.  Edmond never forgot that Robert Kennedy helped him, and after Bobby's tragic death Edmond created The Robert F. Kennedy Chair in Latin American Studies at Harvard University.Republic became one of America's most successful banks.  Through merchandise promotions and acquisitions, it became a leading retail bank with more than one million accounts, while simultaneously developing the world's leading gold trading business.  In 1999, Republic and its European affiliate, Safra Republic Holdings, SA, were sold to HSBC, PLC for approximately $10 billion.Shortly before his tragic death in 1999, Mr. Safra formed the Edmund J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, to carry forward his philanthropic mission.  His foundation, with the guidance and support of his wife, Lily, has honored his memory in many ways: by creating The Edmond J. Safra Hall at The Museum of Jewish Heritage; The Edmond J.

His family traveled to the United States when he was one year old and settled in San Francisco.  His mother, a professional singer, trained him in music and at age 7 first began learning the piano, then the violin at age 9.  He later studied for 3 years with Robert Pollack and for a few months with Louis Persinger.  He also studied until age 15 with Nahum Blinder, whom he considered his only true teacher.  He was later to say : “He taught me how to learn by myself, which is the most important thing a teacher can teach you.”  From this time on, Isaac stern became very interested in chamber music, already playing quartets and quintets with the principals of the San Francisco Orchestra.  At age 15, he performed J.  S.  Bach's Double Concerto on stage with his teacher.  The following year, in 1936, he played a Brahms concerto with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Monteux, then a Tchaikovsky concerto in Los Angeles under Otto Klemperer.  On October 11, 1937, he made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall, and appeared again in February 1939.  This new public appearance was hailed by enthusiastic critics, placing him at the forefront of musicians of his generation.  During World War II, he gave many concerts for the Armed Forces.In January 1943, Isaac Stern gave his first Carnegie Hall recital.  The following year, he appeared twice with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos.  In 1945, he made his first recordings for Columbia Records, and the following year, he was chosen by Hollywood to double the violin parts for the actor John Garfield in the movie “Humoresque.”  Thereafter, he went on to play with the greatest conductors,  Sir Thomas Beecham, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Bruno Walter, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein and George Szell.  He played the part of Eugène Ysaÿe in the film “Tonight We Sing,” relating the life of the great impresario Sol Hurok.  In 1948, he made his European debut at the Lucerne Festival, and in 1950, he took part in the first Prades Festival, organized with Pablo Casals by Alexander Schneider to celebrate the 200th anniversary of J.  S.  Bach's death.  He again appeared with Casals during the following years in Perpignan and Prades, and a few years later at the Puerto Rico Festival.  His meeting with the famous cellist was a determinant influence and led him to devote part of his activity to chamber music, with Eugene Istomin, Alexander Schneider, William Primrose or Paul Tortelier.  In the early 1960s, he organized a trio with Eugene Istomin and Leonard Rose, which became extremely successful and toured widely until Rose's death in 1984.  In 1956, during the cold war, he was also one of the first United States musicians to tour widely in the USSR.  On the other hand, he always refused to play in Germany, in memory of the atrocities committed under Nazi rule.  He had very strong ties with the State of Israel and collaborated assiduously with Israeli-American cultural centers and foundations, providing advice and support to young musicians in that country.  He played an important role as a pedagogue and mentor for such young Israeli virtuosi as Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Myriam Fried, Sergiu Luca and Shlomo Mintz.In addition to his activity as a violinist, Isaac Stern participated intensively in American musical life, making important contributions as music director for the National Council for the Arts.  After 1960, he was Chairman of Carnegie Hall, that prestigious concert hall which, with others, he saved from demolition.  In 1979, he made a trip to China, and the film relating this event, “From Mao to Mozart” was awarded an Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1981.  Many contemporary works were composed for Isaac Stern, including William Schuman's Concerto in 1950, Leonard Bernstein's Serenade in 1954, George Rochberg's Concerto in 1975, Penderecki's Concerto No. 1 in 1977, Dutilleux's Concerto in 1985 and Maxwell Davies’ Concerto in 1986.  In 1987, Isaac Stern formed a new trio with Yo Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, which performed and recorded in the company of such artists as Jaime Laredo and Cho-Liang Lin.  A symbol of American violin playing for over 50 years, he was also one of the greatest 20th century masters.  Isaac Stern died on September 22, 2001.\",\n",

       "  'reason': \"Marion Castellano was born on September 5, 1925 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.  By the time she reached her eleventh birthday her father had passed away from pneumonia.  She began cleaning apartments at age eleven to help her family make ends meet and became a forewoman in a dress factory at age seventeen.  Marion learned responsibility at an early age and she became the secondary income to her mother as the middle child of three girls.  Being an adept seamstress from her years in the factory, Marion would donate clothing she made to the poorer families from her church, Our Lady of Solace.  When her parish's school was unable to afford desperately needed maintenance, Marion organized fundraisers and bake sales to assist them in reaching their goals.  During World War II, she worked making army field jackets to help in the war effort and became politically and socially aware during that turbulent time.  Marion married in 1946 and she and  her husband raised three children, living behind a candy store, which they opened on Bath Avenue in the late 1950’s.  As a small candy store owner, working seven days a week, Marion still found the time to become manager for the local little league team. Marion's community awareness expanded to the political arena in the 1960's when she became Captain of the 16th  Republican Assembly District of Kings County.  She was also a Kings County committeewoman and worked as a troubleshooter during elections for her district.  In 1965, being the natural organizer that she was, Marion began the Cropsey Park Concert Series, which drew thousands for free rock music events.  Speeches by Abe Stark, Louis Lefkowitz and Dizzy Gillespie, became commonplace.  To this day, these concerts are still being enjoyed each summer at the park.  In 1967, she and her husband Phil opened up Bath Music, located in Bensonhurst, which she operated until her passing.  Marion became the heart of the music scene in her community.  She would open at any hour to help a musician in need.  She tried to instill the strong ethics she had into them.  She worked through many troubled times with them, helping many to get help for their drug or alcohol addictions.  Mama and Papa, as she and her husband were commonly known, also donated instruments to local schools, churches, charitable organizations, and even to the police marching band.  Although she was kind, she was not a pushover.  Standing just 4’11”, she disarmed a 6’1” bandit who had come to rob her, by knocking the gun out of his hand and kicking him to the ground.  This was chronicled in several local papers.Marion kept a community bulletin board in her store and would refer people in need to the proper City agency.  Children particularly moved her.  Any child in need became one of hers.  She helped to reunite a runaway, who was in a cult, with her parents.  She worked personally with mentally and emotionally challenged children from the neighborhood.  She worked to get them benefits, to have them removed from abusive households, and get them settled in community homes, or in some instances, apartments of their own.  She helped Chin and Leroy Chow for over 25 years, after their families abandoned them.  She was a lifesaver, literally.  A woman passing the store started screaming and panicking when she saw that her infant child had choked, stopped breathing, and was starting to turn blue.  Marion rushed to the carriage grabbed the baby by her feet and whacked her on the back, dislodging the blockage.  In countless cases, either running to help people in accidents on her busy avenue, assisting people fallen from epilepsy, or just coming to the aid of those who could not help themselves, Marion knew the solution to each problem was to get involved.Marion Castellano died on March 1, 2000.  Over a thousand people attended her wake and flowers overflowed four rooms and wrapped around the foyer of the funeral parlor.  The wake had to be extended an extra day and the funeral director at Miraglia Chapels exclaimed that in his thirty years he had never seen such an overwhelming amount of respect.  She was selfless throughout her life, and never looked for acknowledgement for her countless good deeds.  She was the backbone of her community.\",\n",

After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of the City of New York, Mr. Lee pursued a legal career, obtaining his Bachelor of Laws degree from Brooklyn Law School of St.  Lawrence University.  He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1937.Shortly after the beginning of World War II, in March 1942, Charles Lee enlisted in the United States Army.  After his enlistment, and prior to his European tour of duty, Charles married Anita K.  Lee on August 2, 1942.  The marriage would last for 58 years until his death.  A medic in the 271st Infantry of the 69th Division of the Army, he served in England, France, Belgium and Germany.  During this tour, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge, which was the largest land battle of World War II.  Throughout the War, Mr. Lee utilized his linguistic skills in French and German by serving as an interpreter for his unit as it traveled through Europe, and also after the War, when he remained in Germany to assist with liberation efforts.  He was awarded the Bronze Star for heroic and meritorious achievement.  After World War II,  Mr. Lee resumed his legal career as a sole general practitioner, often serving less fortunate clients as a court appointed criminal defense lawyer.  Early in his career, he served as an Assistant Attorney General of the State of New York (1956 – 1957).  He was also appointed as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (1953 – 1955).  He later served as counsel to the Bronx Borough President.  During the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, Mr. Lee was appointed to serve as Hearing Commissioner for the New York City Department of Markets, and later as the first Director of the City’s new Firearms Control Board.Charles Lee, described as a man who was the epitome of character, intellect, wit, generosity, loyalty, devotion and integrity, was dedicated to the Bronx Republican Party.  He was a District Leader, and carried his party’s banner as a candidate for numerous political and judicial positions.  In his later years he was valued as an elder statesman and a guiding light to his younger colleagues.  His strength of character, devotion and hard work earned him a stellar reputation and many friendships among his colleagues, and also earned him the respect and admiration of his political opponents.Charles Lee, a man of many accomplishments, was always proud of his Bronx roots and always willing to serve his borough and the Pelham Parkway community.  He served as president of a local chapter of B’nai B’rith, helped to organize the Pelham Parkway Citizen’s Council, served as an Officer and Board Member of the Federal Bar Association, and as a Board Member of the Pelham Parkway Jewish Center.

       "  'reason': 'Julie Lobbia was a remarkable advocate and journalist, who reminded her readers of the original muckrakers; humanists who sought out the truth through their writing and reporting.  J.A.  Lobbia, as she was better known, through her Village Voice column “Towers and Tenements,” tirelessly dug up information and pursued stories and leads that would show what was really going on for tenants in New York.  Lobbia’s journalism – and its incredible advocacy for the rights of tenants all over New York City – has had an immeasurable impact on our City.  It is for this lifetime of accomplishment that Manhattan Community Board No. 5 has approved naming a stretch of the bike lane on Sixth Avenue in her honor.When J.A. Lobbia went to work, she put her heart and soul into it.  Her “Towers and Tenements” column covered the City’s affordable housing crisis, the State’s weakening of rent regulation laws, the strident efforts of the tenants’ movements, and exposed the shameful ways of certain slumlords and developers. A true sign that someone really cares about an issue is his or her dedication, even after the workday is done.  When J.A. Lobbia would be biking through neighborhoods, she would take notice eviction notices and stop to give advice if she could.  She even noticed an eviction notice written in Chinese, had it translated so that she could read it, wrote a response, had it translated back into Chinese, and slipped it under the door.  Also, she actively volunteered her time at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, and as a tutor in the Immigrant Literacy Project of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart.For her efforts and diligent dedication to journalism, Lobbia received many awards.  Among these are the 2001 Front Page Award from the Newswomen’s Club of NY, Scales of Justice Media Award from Mobilization for Youth Legal Services, Best Columnist Award from the Society of Professional Journalism, and a Golden Typewriter Award for Public Interest in Journalism.J.A. Lobbia was not only an intelligent, capable journalist, but she was a selfless person who gave back to the society her heart and hand.  She unfortunately died from cancer in 2001 at the young age of 43.  Even throughout her illness, Lobbia continued to be out on the streets, getting stories and helping other people.Although known and admired by most for her work on tenants rights, J.A. Lobbia was involved in other issues.  Among those were transportation and traffic, in that she was an avid cyclist.  When she was sick, she was quoted as saying that when she died, she would want to be “buried in a dress and bike shoes.”  For a person who gave so much to the tenants of New York City, there seems no better tribute than naming a bike lane in her honor.

       "  'reason': \"Founded in 1916, Plaza College first began as an independent institution based in Long Island City.  As long-range plans indicated a need for more space, the college moved to 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights in 1970.  With additional accommodations available, the College has continued to develop and build an outstanding learning environment for its students.  Academic support, counseling, and placement services reach out to each student, ensuring a successful educational experience.  The development of computer facilities, course offerings, and other enhancements to the life of the college community clearly reflects the college’s history of responding to dramatic changes in technology and the nature of business.  From a historical perspective, notable Plaza College events include the development of its two-year programs - 1975; authorization by the Board of Regents of the State of New York to confer the degree of Associate in Occupational Studies (A.O.S.) - 1982; authorization to confer the degree of Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) - 1988; Middle States Candidacy – 1997.  The college was accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools on March 6, 2002.The 1990’s continued to be a period of extensive development for the College.  With completion of Bruson Hall, the size of the College nearly doubled.  This made possible an expanded library, internet facility, Learning Resource Center, additional computer classrooms, student lounge, and special events hall.  These additions have made the learning environment at Plaza College a special place to be.  Efforts also proceeded in developing “The Computer Business Support Specialist,” a new degree program of study, designed to offer students an intense focus on computer software, hardware and network operations.To meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, the college is committed to achieving strategic planning goals and building upon its strengths through the outcomes assessment process.  The year 2003 will mark Plaza's 87th year of service to the community of Queens.\",\n",

Khay was constantly doing favors for his neighbors – as he was doing while helping the Walits find the gas leak which caused the explosion.Leon “Khay” Cochran was born on January 6, 1926 in Missouri, and was raised by his maternal grandparents and great aunt.  He was educated in a one-room schoolhouse, which his grandfather had built.  He attended high school first, in Louisiana, then Missouri, and finished while living on his aunt’s ranch in Denver, Colorado.  He loved music and singing, and was a member of the Denver Cathedral choir.  He attended the University of Missouri for two years, until deciding to study voice in New York.  He transferred to Columbia University, where he studied for two more years, and also worked on his singing talents.  Like many young singers at the time, he acted as a “super” at the Metropolitan Opera.  It was there that he met his future partner of 53 years, Julian Jackson.He held several jobs after college, and eventually went to work at R.W.  Pressprich & Co., as a stock and bond trader.  He was promoted to head the “cage” and then to customer service representative.  While working as a trader, he continued to pursue music.  He was given a chance to sing with the Don Cessach Choir, and he left Wall Street to follow that opportunity.  He sang with the choir for over 16 years around the globe.  When not on tour, Khay sang with a Russian operatic group on the Upper West Side.  He was immediately named lead tenor, singing in such works as “Boris Godenov” and  “Prince Igor.”Khay was an inveterate collector, and moved to Boerum Hill in 1973 as to have more space.  After 9 years of renovations, Khay turned an empty shell with no electricity or plumbing into a beautiful rowhouse.George Dalrowski, the great Russian baritone, referred to Khay as having “the great voice of the century.”  His voice was known all over Europe, and was often invited to sing with prominent European opera companies, offers he never took advantage of.  Even more distinguished than his voice was Khay’s devotion to helping others.  It was this devotion that lead to his untimely death.',\n",

People moving into the once-gorgeous rowhouses had to be willing to live on a treeless street, inhabit shells of buildings, and work tirelessly to renovate, repair, and rebuild to have livable homes.  The Walits, undaunted, jumped right in.  Even as the neighborhood changed, they would be major figures in their little area, serving to cement ties holding people together, until their tragic deaths.Leonard Walit, 72, was an accountant, an avid reader, a fan of history and a loving husband.  He attended Lincoln High School, then Brooklyn College, followed by graduate courses at NYU.  Together with his wife, Harriet, they served as the center of their neighborhood, transforming it into a pleasant oasis in an otherwise gritty part of Brooklyn.  Although they had no children, they were often considered to be the “mom and pop” of the neighborhood by others, due to their incredibly open hearts, an unending desire to serve the common good and their warm and loving personalities.Harriet Walit, 66, was born and raised in Hazelton, Pennsylvania.  After High School, Harriet attended Misericordia and Penn State Colleges, graduating with a Masters of Social Work degree.  After marrying Leonard and moving to Boerum Hill, Mrs. Walit served on the board of Stepping Stone, a neighborhood halfway house, and volunteered with the Salvation Army.  ',\n",

Paul received his education in a Catholic elementary school and public high school.  At the age of 17, Paul’s grandmother passed away, leaving him to arrange sleeping in relatives and friends homes.  At one point, Paul stayed with Langston Hughes, where Paul Ramos learned about music and refined his taste in jazz and poetry.From 1960-1963, Paul worked at the Veterans Administration Hospital as an Operating Room Technician.  In 1964 he began work as a trainer at a management-engineering firm.  Because of his background in hospital work, he was assigned to monitor proprietary health institutions and related agencies that included nursing homes, private clinics and group practices.  In 1965 he began working for several Lower East Side community organizations, where he counseled “problem children” and obtained private funds for reading and tutoring programs.  He educated parents in health care delivery and how to avail themselves of the resources in the community.In 1966 he accepted a position in the Community Development and Education Department of the Gouverneur Health Services Program.  In this capacity, he monitored the delivery of health care to patients and organized a crisis intervention unit, focused on welfare, housing and relocation of families.  Paul devoted the rest of his life to the nurturing and growth of what is today the Betances Health Center, located at 80 Henry Street.  Paul Ramos worked tirelessly for over 30 years to promote health equity and to expand the quality of affordable health care for all in one of New York’s most diverse and underserved neighborhoods, the Lower East Side.As an early and active supporter of patient advocacy, he initiated local changes, which improved health care for the disadvantaged.  He developed the Betances Health Unit, a grassroots mobile health unit, into the state of the art community health care center.  This center has emerged through his vision into a proto-type for community health, one that continues its commitment to culturally respectful, compassionate care.In the early 1980’s, when HIV emerged, Paul’s infinite wisdom and compassion led Betances to the forefront as one of the first community health centers to begin to provide ongoing counseling, treatment and primary care to those living with HIV and AIDS.  For years, Paul was associated himself with the Lower East Side Task Force on AIDS, the Latino Commission on AIDS and the AIDS Service Center, of which he was the board chair until his untimely passing in May 2000.

Born Jeffrey Hyman on May 19, 1951 in Forest Hills, Queens, the gawky geek decked out in sunglasses and black leather would found the Ramones in 1974, with friends Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy.  Each adopted the surname Ramone, after a stage name (Ramon) used by Paul McCartney during the earliest Beatles days.Best known for such two-minute anthems as “I Wanna Be Sedated,” “Blitzkrieg Bop” “Rockaway Beach” and “Teenage Lobotomy,” the Ramones are credited with founding what would later be dubbed “punk rock.”  According to legend, it was all an accident.  Novices on their instruments, the quartet knew four chords and played them at breakneck speed to prevent listeners from discerning the mistakes.  An average concert consisted of about three dozen songs in about 90 minutes.  Punk caught on and found a home at the downtown Manhattan club CBGBs, where the Ramones performed with like-minded souls Richard Hell, Patti Smith and Television.  After a Ramones tour in 1976, the genre spread to England, where the Sex Pistols and Damned copied what they saw but added a more rebellious edge.In 1979, the Ramones appeared in the Roger Corman movie Rock 'n' Roll High School, recording the title song for the soundtrack.  Ten years later they contributed the title track to Pet Cemetery, based on the book by Stephen King.  But mainstream crossover success consistently eluded them.  Although their fiercely delivered, wincingly inane pop songs about social misfits were hailed as rock classics, none ever cracked the Top 40.  The Ramones commercial profile consistently paled in comparison to each new generation of groups they inspired--from the Clash and Blondie, through the Offspring and Green Day (two of whose members named children after the Ramones) and now Blink-182 and Fenix TX.Over 22 years and several lineup changes the Ramones recorded 13 albums.  They released their last, “Adios Amigos,” and broke up in 1996, after performing a farewell show – their 2,263rd – with guests including Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.Joey Ramone died of lymphatic cancer on April 15, 2001, which he had been battling for about seven years.  He died in his hospital bed, and is said to have passed when U2’s “A Little While” concluded.  Not only was he the front man for his band, he was the front man of a generation of punk rockers.  More than any of his contemporaries, Joey Ramone was the figurehead for the New York punk scene that spawned many favorite bands.\",\n",

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn.  At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.A lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens high school a year ahead of her scheduled class.  Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism.  In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities.  Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper.  Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s University, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.Michelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education.  While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center.  There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children.  Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law.  In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former United States Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.After graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County.  While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond.  In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy.  Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community.  While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law.  Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard.  Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.Michelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing.  In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so.  A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published.  A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College fund.In 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer.  Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community.  Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer.  She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.On July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end.

       "  'reason': \"The following information is from the McClung Museum exhibition “Cartier: The Jewler’s Art” at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.Founded in 1847 in Paris by Louis-François Cartier, the firm became one of the world's greatest designers and manufacturers of jewelry and objets d'art, and a supplier to royalty, nobility, and millionaires.Until the end of the 19th century, Cartier was primarily a retailer of jewelry and objects produced by outside manufacturers. When Cartier's son Alfred took over in 1874, the firm gradually began repairing and improving jewelry, and then designing and manufacturing their own original pieces in the late 1800’s. In 1899, the move to 13 Rue de la Paix situated the business in the heart of the important jewelry and couturier quarter of Paris.Encouraged by King Edward VII, Cartier opened a branch in London in 1902 managed by Alfred's son Jacques. A royal commission was granted in 1904, followed quickly by commissions from Spain, Portugal, Russia, Siam, and Greece. These royal commissions helped to solidify Cartier's reputation among the wealthy and famous the world over.To better deal with American millionaires, who from the beginning formed a large part of Cartier's clientele, a New York branch was opened in 1909 by Alfred's other son, Pierre. Until World War I, Cartier maintained close relations with clients in Russia, and the princes and maharajas of India sought Cartier to design and mount their jewels. Jewelry and accessories were also made as stock items for the stores or were commissioned by individuals.Until the 1960’s, the Paris, London, and New York branches were part of a single firm but operated independently, collaborating whenever necessary. In 1962, the New York branch was sold, followed by the Paris branch in 1965, thus ending the unity. The firm was reunited and reorganized in 1979 as Cartier Monde, and today shops and boutiques can be found in cities around the world.With each of the branches headed by a Cartier brother, the first four decades of the 20th century were a time of originality in design and technique in which a distinctive Cartier aesthetic emerged.  The name change is in recognition of the historic business relationship between the City of New York and Cartier Jewelers.  Pierre Cartier, the founder of the New York company for the Cartier family, lived on 52nd Street in the house where the business is now located.  The home was originally purchased with a Cartier necklace.\",\n",

At that time, and until the adoption of the modern street grid in the Town of Flatbush, Martense Lane was a colonial-era dirt road that connected the Gowanus Road at 35th Street and Fourth Avenue with the Flatbush Road (now Avenue) at the Dutch Reformed Church.  Martense was one of the principal British routes of advance.  Starting from Gravesend, the British center marched to New Utrecht, near the Dutch Reformed Church, and then north.  This force, mostly Hessians and Scots Highlanders, turned east and proceeded down Church Lane (now Avenue) to the Dutch Reformed Church, where they camped.  They skirmished with the Americans, and the Continental Army burned the Lefferts Homestead.  The next day they proceeded up Flatbush Road to attack the Americans at Battle Pass in Prospect Park.Part of the British left marched up Old New Utrecht and down Martense Lane, and began the Battle of Long Island at the intersection of Martense and Gowanus at about 2 AM on August 27th.  They met American forces under William Alexander and Lord Sterling, who later attacked the British at the Old Stone House, and sustained 256 dead, mostly from the Maryland Battalion, to cover the American retreat towards the Brooklyn Ferry.Martense Lane is part of the New York State American Revolution Heritage Trail in Brooklyn.',\n",

He spent his entire life living and promoting the Coney Island lifestyle as a lifelong resident, as a Second World War veteran, as a bath house operator and as a bar and restaurant proprietor.  Ruby’s always pleasant promotion of the beach made him a tireless spokesman for Coney Island, whether talking to the national press or speaking one on one with customers.  His last establishment, Ruby’s Bar, remains to this day an unofficial old timers hangout and museum with hundreds of photos of Coney Island in its heyday.The many conveyed a charm and inner peace that he always attributed to the beach, which he referred to as “the elixir of life.”  Coney Island is an amusement park that cannot compete with Disneyland of Great Adventure in terms of state of the art rides, but Coney Island is the richest amusement park in the world when we value proprietors and advocates such as Ruby Jacobs.Few people loved and believed in Coney Island as much as Ruby Jacobs, who was sometimes called “the jewel” of Coney Island.  For over forty years, in a very quiet way, Ruby provided a safe haven for visitors while preserving the celebrated traditions of “the World’s Most Famous Playground.”  During the 1960’s and 1970’s, Ruby operated Coney Island’s historic boardwalk bathhouses and landmarks with a rich and storied past: Stauch’s, Claret’s, and Bushman’s.When the last of the bathhouses closed, Ruby opened the Old Tyme Restaurant, which he operated with his brother Phil.  The establishment became famous both as a gallery displaying historic images of Coney Island’s past glories and as a popular gathering place for old timers and new visitors alike.When others gave up on the area during its decline, Ruby refused to do so.  His love and passion for Coney Island never wavered.  When a customer asked him what the best thing on the restaurant’s menu was, he would reply with a wave of his hand, “Look out there in the ocean, smell the air and look at the whole tapestry of people that come to Coney Island.  That’s the best item on the menu.”  Ruby Jacobs died on April 5, 2000.',\n",

       "  'reason': \"Austin Jacobo was born on a sugar cane plantation in the Dominican Republic on January 5, 1929. He learned very early to fight for his rights and the rights of others. His community work began in Consuelo, Dominican Republic in 1951 helping the Catholic Church develop and organize the community. He  was involved in improving housing conditions, and providing family, sports and youth leadership programs. In 1966 he became a scout for the Houston Astros major league baseball team. ‘Jacobo’ as he was affectionately called, had to escape the Dominican Republic because of his involvement as a union organizer. He had to flee his country unexpectedly and leave his family behind. The government considered him a communist because he believed in the rights of people. He spoke against the government and organized the people in protests and job actions. He did not stand down to the government even thought it almost cost him his life. The Catholic Church helped him escape to Canada and later he immigrated to the United States.He came to the United States in 1970. Although he did not speak the language as well as the people in the community, the strength of his convictions prompted him to get involved with the people in his community almost immediately. He began by getting involved with sports via youth programs. He worked as a janitor for Saint Martin of Tours, a local Catholic Church that he asked to allow him to open the gymnasium to create a place where young people could go and play in order to be out of the streets. He was the president of the Crotona Community Coalition for 25 years. Under his leadership, the community was transformed. As a visionary leader, he believed that the family unit is the center of the community. Jacobo understood hat nurturing the family and its needs would have a positive impact on decreasing crime and violence in the community. Housing was a big issue. He first began to fight for rent control, heating of the buildings, and renovation of the apartments. Next, Jacobo redoubled his efforts to find places and activities to involve the youth, keep them away from drugs. As he expanded his vision, he and his staff had to explore external community organizations and people that would help them obtain their goals. The Coalition reached out to politicians, private and public industries and any one else who benefits from the community. Through his leadership and that of the Crotona Community Coalition, the community received a 3 million dollar grant from Mayor Koch and the organization was able to build its first ballpark and maintain a sports program. Through the years the community has built two more parks with additional grants obtained by the coalition under Jacobo's leadership. The Crotona Community Coalition also began to buy buildings and build affordable housing. One of his big dreams for the community was to build a community center. He was able to help create the community center called the Mary Mitchell Center, which has been open since 1998. This Center is the epitome of Jacobo's primary goal of keeping the youth off the streets and away from drugs.Jacobo always wore a green baseball cap, which become a symbol of his mission. As an authentic leader he had “the integrity to walk the talk and talk the walk, self-awareness of his feelings and actions, sensitivity and empathy toward and in relationship to the community”. Austin Jacobo died on March 20, 2002. He was survived by his wife, Altagracia; three daughters, Anna, Amerelis and Astrid, all of The Bronx; a son, Astin Jr., of The Bronx; and three grandchildren.\",\n",

He was a great leader who served as a catalyst and voice for the American Civil Rights Movement. Born in Atlanta on January 15, 1929, he was the second child of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. A highly motivated child, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Morehouse College to study religion at age 15. He was a junior in college when he was ordained a minister and made the assistant pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church. In 1948, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Crozier Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he began to seriously study the life and work of Mohandas K. Ghandi. \"I came to see for the first time,\" King wrote, \"that the Christian doctrine of love, operating through the Ghandhian method of nonviolence, is one of the most potent weapons available to an oppressed people in the struggle for freedom.\" While working toward his doctorate degree in Systematic Theology at Boston University, Martin Luther King, Jr. met and married Coretta Scott. In May, 1954, he became the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Dr. King was thrust into the forefront when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man. Her courage triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott and created a citywide protest against local segregation laws. Dr. King organized the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and advised African-Americans to boycott buses and picket businesses who were in favor of segregation. In 1956, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\\'s bus segregation laws were unconstitutional. The victory established Dr. King as a national leader and paved the way for desegregation in other areas, most notably in public schools systems around the country. In 1957, Dr. King helped organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to end segregation using non-violent protests. He led numerous demonstrations against discrimination including rallies, sit-ins, the Freedom Rides and voter registration drives. The most memorable of demonstrations was the 1963 March on Washington where he delivered his famed \"I Have A Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. These efforts received international acclaim and recognition when Dr. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King through his powerful and sincere speeches, renewed the hopes, determination and spirit of all people seeking to improve their own lives. He inspired some to advance the principles of humanity nationwide and around the world. Dr. King\\'s last protest took place on March 28, 1968 when he led a march in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking sanitation workers. He was assassinated seven days later on April 4, while staying at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1985, President Reagan signed a proclamation declaring the third Monday in January a public holiday in honor of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ',\n",

Then in 1914, a generous donation from Ms. Elvia Zabriskio enabled School Settlement to move to a facility built specifically for it at 120 Jackson Street, the site School Settlement inhabits to this day.Although the neighborhood has changed during the past century, the situation of educational deficiency Ms. Demonde encountered still exists.

Homework help, arts and crafts, computer instruction, literacy and structured recreation are only a sample of the programs School Settlement offers.  School Settlement also offers an AIDP program under the CAPS initiative within Automotive High School as well as a teen night program on-site, designed to offer youth an opportunity to feel relaxed, have fun and express themselves in a smoke-free, drug free and violence free environment.School Settlement has been in the same community for over a century and in the same location for almost eighty years.

He went to work early and was only 14 when he became a warehouseman at the Morel meat packing warehouse at North 10th Street and Kent Avenue. He enlisted in the Army in 1937, and when his tour of duty was over in 1940 he went back to warehouse work. However, the United States entered World War II a year later and he was back in uniform again as a Combat Engineer. Nicholas was awarded the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action for risking his life to carry several officers to safety when they were thrown from a bridge that was being shelled.Returning to the Northside after the war, Nick briefly went back to warehouse work, passed the test for the Sanitation Department, and worked there for 30 years. He was honored for his valor at Sanitation also after he pulled a police officer from the flaming wreckage of his motorcycle.After returning from the service, Nick married his one and only love, Teresa, and they had a wonderful daughter. The love and support of his family gave Nick the strength to fight for his community. On his own time, Nick began helping community people get the things they needed to survive. He was the troubleshooter, complaints bureau and ombudsman for everything that touched people’s lives. In the early, years he would take people to the political clubhouse to get help there. Later on, he developed contacts directly to governmental offices and programs, although he never forgot the importance of political strength. Nick connected people and neighborhood institutions to the programs and services they needed.As vital as his help was to many people, Nick made his mark through larger issues. He led the fight against S&S Corrugated Paper Machinery when the City condemned 92 apartments to prevent S&S from moving its jobs elsewhere. Although the neighborhood fought to the last, many residents were dragged out of their homes while the bulldozers waited on the sidewalks, the houses were destroyed. In spite of this defeat, Nick and other community people had come together to form the Northside Community Development Council to fight for replacement housing, a senior citizens center and to make sure that nothing so destructive would ever again tear apart their neighborhood. Thirty years later, the Northside Community Development Council is still working to improve the environment. The Northside Senior Center is still providing services to our long-time neighbors. The homes on North 3rd Street and 4th Street are still strengthening the neighborhood.Nicholas Polonski died on April 20, 1999.

She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life.Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school.Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence.Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.',\n",

A ten-time Grammy nominee, Cruz, who sang only in her native Spanish language, received a Smithsonian Lifetime Achievement award, a National Medal of the Arts and honorary doctorates from Yale University and the University of Miami. A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress. Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city’s poor Santo Suárez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called “La hora del té” and with her mother’s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba.Cruz’s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers’ college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana’s National Conservatory of Music—but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career.Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Mantancera. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band’s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matencera disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950’s.At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz’s parents deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed.Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\",\n",

By 1893, they established a residence and sculpture studio at 467 E. 142nd Street in the Mott Haven section of The Bronx. The studio closed in 1945, the year that three of the brothers died. It was demolished in the 1970’s and the site is currently occupied by a Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Hall.Original Piccirilli sculptures can be found throughout New York City and the United States. The Maine Monument at the southwest corner of Central Park (near Columbus Circle) is probably the best known original Piccirilli work. Other original Piccirilli sculptures in New York City include the Fireman’s memorial on Riverside Drive and West 100th Street, the large glass sculpture, “Youth Leading Industry”, over the entrance to 636 Fifth Avenue in Rockefeller Center (opposite St. Patrick’s Cathedral) and the Policeman’s Memorial at One Police Plaza.The brothers, Ferruccio, Attilio, Furio, Masaniello, Orazio and Grtulio, were also master marble carvers. Many sculptures brought their plaster casts to the studio to be carved in marble. Their best-known carving project was the Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C.’s Lincoln Memorial. In New York they carved the Library Lions at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, all of the sculptures on the Washington Arch in Greenwich Village, the pediment of the New York Stock Exchange, and many others.In between commissions for large public sculptures, the brothers produced many small works – often for their own artistic interests. Most of these are in museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or in private collections.Attilio was co-founder of the Leonardo da Vinci Art School originally located at 288 East 10th Street in Manhattan. The school offered art education to thousands of working class New Yorkers from 1923 to 1940. Several students won the prestigious Prix de Rome, and Isamu Noguchi received his early training at “The Leonardo”.The Piccirilli brothers kept a fairly low profile but were well known in certain circles. Virtually all the sculptors of their time visited the studio. Some worked there, and some actually lived there. The studio had become an important center for American art. Teddy Roosevelt, Enrico Caruso, and John D. Rocafeller also visited the studio. Fiorello LaGuardia was a close friend to the family for decades. “The Leonardo” received testimonials from Calvin Coolidge, Thomas Edison, Al Smith and many, many others.',\n",

In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5.Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts.In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman\\'s cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister.Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason/Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet\\'s trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister\\'s family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York.By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves.With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman”, published in 1869, were a great financial help.In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis\\' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died, of pneumonia. She was 93 years old.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Allen and Pike Streets, and the neighborhoods that overlap across it, Chinatown and the Lower East Side, are a gateway for immigrants to the United States.  Thousands of immigrant families have lived in the tenements, finding creative ways to forge new lives for themselves.  In the process of struggling to overcome poor housing and working conditions, generations of immigrants have shaped, and continue to shape, the identity and development of the community.Named after heroes from the War of 1812, Allen and Pike Streets has long been an important corridor for immigrant settlement.  From the early 1800’s to the 1960’s, this thoroughfare was in a dense neighborhood of Eastern European Jews, Irish, Polish, Italian, and German Immigrants and African-American migrants.  Subsequent waves of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Chinese immigrant have expanded the cultural and economic vibrancy of the neighborhood.  The new “main streets” of Chinatown—East Broadway, Division, Canal, and Grand Street—cross Allen Street, making it the new central spine of Chinatown.The physical condition of Allen and Pike Streets, however, has fallen into disrepair.  The demolition of the elevated Second Avenue Subway and buildings along streets’ east side did not lead to the creation of a boulevard where neighborhood residents and visitors could come together for leisurely conversations, strolls and festivities.During an almost two-year community planning process to define a vision for Chinatown’s future (the Rebuild Chinatown initiative), Allen Street was identified by residents and merchants as an important community asset for the rich immigrant histories that it hold and the entrepreneurial, religious, and social activities that it sustains,  It has also become recognized for its potential to become a prominent boulevard that unifies the diverse immigrant groups living in Chinatown and the Lower East Side and a major connection to the waterfront that can be safely used by pedestrians and bicyclist.Hence, the idea to name Allen and Pike Streets, “Avenue of the Immigrants” and give immigrants of the past and the present the recognition they deserve.  The recognition is not only symbolic, however.  It is also intended to generate public and private investment into physical improvements that will transform this corridor into a real boulevard with a visible, multi-ethnic identity.',\n",

Unfortunately he wasn’t able to receive it first hand due to the fact that he passed away only at the prime age of 45.Having a street name sign reading “Firefighter Daniel Perricone Place” be placed underneath the Lyon Place street name sign at the southeast corner of Watchogue Road will serve as a reminder for the heroes who risk their own lives for the lives of other that they are recognized for it.',\n",

The empty building was located on the south-east corner of West 122nd Street and Morningside Avenue, on the western boarder of Harlem.  That empty building was to become Church of the Master, Presbyterian.  It was a church building of gothic revival design and had been erected in 1894 as Morningside Presbyterian Church.  Around 1930, however, Harlem began bursting at the seams with the continuous arrival of African-American immigrants from the South and elsewhere.  Harlem residents began to move across northern Manhattan and into the predominantly white neighborhoods, around Morningside Church.  The struggle for territory was a furious one, and often erupted in violence, but by 1938, the congregation of the Morningside Church had become so depleted that the Presbytery of New York dissolved it.  From March to May 1938, the building sat empty.  James H. Robinson, who grew up in Knoxville, TN, would revive the building and create the Church of the Master.  From the moment he opened the doors in 1938 until he took a leave in 1959, the church was a whirl wing of activity.  The sermons he delivered were almost always very inspiring, educational and spiritually gratifying.  People from all over the world, at one time or another, were attracted to the Church.  In 1959, Rev. Robinson took a leave in order to raise money for a new building.  The Operation Crossroads Africa, however, required so much of his time that in 1961 he retired and became the Church’s first pastor emeritus.

He came to New York City in 1929 and was converted in a street service in Harlem in 1934, under the preaching of the Mexican pastor, Rev. Eleuterio Paz. With the untiring support of his wife, Filomena, he responded to God\\'s call to ministry. He served as an Assistant Pastor for several years and then in 1943 accepted the pastorate of a “store front” mission with 12 members—“Iglesia Cristiana Juan 3:16”. The struggles and triumphs of Rev. Tañon in developing this “store-front” church in the Bronx amidst poverty, prejudice, institutional racism, and Anglo Protestant apathy is documented well in his biography (Ramon Sanchez, Ricardo Tañon: El Poder y la Gloria de Dios, San Juan, Puerto Rico: Romualdo Real, 1980).During the 34 year pastorate of Rev. Tañon at “Juan 3:16”, 17 new churches were planted throughout the Northeast, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; 54 pastors nurtured at \"Juan 3:16\" and sent out all over the Spanish-speaking world; hundreds trained at the Bible Institutes; one year alone 12 full-time Bible School students were mobilized and fully supported by the church. The church grew and developed a Sunday School with an average attendance of over 1,500 (with a staff of 120), over 1,000 attending every Sunday night worship service and at baptismal and evangelistic services 2,000 would “jam” the church. At one time it had the largest Hispanic Christian bookstore in the Northeast, whose profit at one point helped support 20 missionaries in foreign fields; a church library for its members and a print shop (which also produced thousands of Gospel tracts a year for distribution). It had several evangelistic teams and prison ministry teams, several standing Benevolent Programs, and provided the inspiration and leadership for a social service agency in the church\\'s premises serving the church and community at large. At his official retirement on June 28, 1977, the “Iglesia Cristiana Juan 3:16” was the largest Hispanic church in the USA.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Born May 19, 1933, Thomas Feelings is the son Samuel and Anna Nash Feelings.  He grew up in the ultra-urban Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York.  He began to draw at age four, copying pictures from newspaper comic strips into a book of blank papers sewn together by his mother.  He was just a little older when he heard about Thipadeaux, a black artist who was teaching at the Police Athletic Academy in his neighborhood.  The teacher suggested that, rather than copying from other’s people’s work, he try to draw some of the real people in his neighborhood.  He began with his mother and aunt.  He later went on to draw the adults and the wary, diffident children he saw around him.  He attended Cartoonist and Illustrator’s School in NY (1951-1953) and also School of Visual Arts in NY (1956-1960).By 1961 Feelings finished art school with an extensive portfolio.  He tried to obtain freelance assignments but was often told by editors that he was limiting his chances by concentrating solely on black subjects.  By the mid 1970’s Feelings had illustrated six books, including a volume of diary extracts collected by Julius Lester, called To Be A Slave.  Shortly thereafter, he was asked to do ten color illustrations for a new edition of Booker T. Washington’s autobiography, Up from Slavery.  Despite the tragic subject, Feelings found himself continually painting pictures in warm and radiant colors that were quite inappropriate to such a project.  Knowing these pictures would convey a falsely positive image of slavery; he cancelled the contract.If the 1970’s had been a time of new experiences, the 1980s found Feelings firmly grasping the themes that had been germinating within his work since his youth in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  His autobiography, Black Pilgrimage, records a conversation with an eight-year-old girl that probed unforgettable for the artist.  Feelings tried to explain to her that his drawings were of “pretty little black children, like you.”  The young girl expressed her refusal to see anything beautiful about the black children, replying, “Ain’t nothin’ black pretty.”  Feeling’s lifelong dedication to the beauty of African people and their descendants graphically illustrates his inability to accept such a hateful attitude.If any man should be regarded as the personification of the “black is beautiful” philosophy, that man is Thomas Feelings.  Feeling’s has been passionately committed to the mission of encouraging black children to understand their own spiritual and physical beauty.  By Co-naming Putman Ave. to “Tom Feelings Way”, he will be commemorated for remaining faithful to that mission for more than 40 years.',\n",

He was one of the first great American-born ballet masters and also a major Broadway and film choreographer, winning four Tony Awards and two Academy Awards. He was born Jerome Rabinowitz, October 11, 1918, son of Jewish immigrants. As a child he studied the piano and violin as well as dance. He studied ballet with Ula Duganova, Eugene Loring, and Anthony Tudor; modern dance with the New Dance League; interpretive dance with Sonya Robbins; Spanish dance with Helene Viola; and Oriental dance with Nimura, and in 1940 he joined American Ballet Theater as a dancer. In 1942 he choreographed his first ballet, Fancy Free , which recounts the adventures of three young sailors on leave. His style combined more popular dance styles with classical ballet in a way that was new at the time. In 1948 Balanchine invited him to join the newly created New York City Ballet, and in 1950 he received a Dance Magazine Award for his interpretation of Balanchine's Prodigal Son. From 1944 to 1964 he became famous beyond the world of ballet, choreographing for such Broadway musicals as On The Town, Peter Pan, The King and I, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof. It was perhaps with West Side Story , collaborating with Leonard Bernstein, that he reached the pinnacle of his show business career. His dances for the Sharks and the Jets captured the restless spirit and violence of gang warfare. Leaving Broadway behind him, he returned to ballet after 1964. In his career with City Ballet he created some 50 ballets that testify to the diversity of his talent and confirm his place as a 20th century ballet master. In Afternoon of a Faun, created in 1953, he demonstrated his command of the neo-classicism with this cool and mysterious reinventing of Nyjinski's ballet. The Concert created in 1956, is a comic spoof of a classical music concert. Many of his ballets like Dances at a Gathering, have become part of the repertory of companies around the world. After the death of Balanchine in 1983, he shared the post of artistic director of The New York City Ballet with Peter Martins until 1990. He was considered by the dancers as an uncompromising taskmaster. In 1981 he received a Kennedy Center Award. He returned briefly to Broadway in 1989 with an anthology of past hits entitled Jerome Robbin's Broadway. His dedication to dance will live on in his ballets. \",\n",

After France abolished slavery in the territory in 1794, Toussaint supported the French rulers of the country against British invaders and was made a general in 1795. In 1801 he succeeded, after many struggles, in liberating Saint-Domingue from French control and became president for life of a new republic. In 1802 Napoleon sent troops under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc, to subdue the Haitians. Toussaint was defeated, captured, and accused of conspiracy.

       "  'reason': 'Antonio Nobile was born in Calatafimi, Sicily on January 26, 1928.  He was one of nine brothers.  Having only a 5th grade education, Tony began cutting hair at the age of 10, taking lessons from a local barber in his hometown.  At the age of 19, he moved to Florence to work for a Master Barber, a position he retained until leaving Italy.  Antonio married the love of his life, Antoinetta, on January 16, 1958.  Together they raised 5 children, 3 sons that were born in Florence, and 2 daughters that were born in Brooklyn. Tony came to the US on October 12, 1968, settling in Brooklyn.  After taking the Master Barber exam for New York State, a test he passed in only a few minutes, he opened his first barber shop in Bensonhurst.  In 1973, he opened his second shop in Dyker Heights, a business that became a fixture on 11th Avenue for the next three decades.  This shop not only served as a place where customers could get a haircut in less than 10 minutes, but a gathering place for the residents of the area to sit and discuss the political issues of the day.  Tony was such an institution in Dyker Heights that customers would continue patronizing his shop, or just stop by for a visit, even after moving out of the area.The Nobile family were parishioners of Regina Pacis Church.  His children all went to public school and college, something he was not able to do.  He was devoted to his family and generous to his customers.Antonio loved to travel, visiting his beloved Italy 5 times to visit his mother.  He loved to read and enjoyed watching soccer, basketball and boxing, but his main passion was always his barber shop.  Antonio was posthumously inducted into the Barbering Hall of Fame in Canal Winchester, Ohio in September, 2004.  With over 90,000 barbers in the United States, this honor is only bestowed upon 3 people per year.  ',\n",

Davis was born in 1962, graduated from Samuel Tilden High School in 1980 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Pace University in 1989.  Upon graduation, James Davis joined the New York City Corrections Department, serving for two years at Riker’s Island before joining the New York City Transit Department as a police officer.  In 1993 he was transferred to the New York City Police Department and upon graduation was assigned to the 73rd Precinct in his home borough of Brooklyn, later teaching social science as a certified New York State instructor at the New York City Police Academy and a Youth Officer at the 69th Precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn.  Prior to elected office, he made many strides to combat negative influences on children in his community including his successful crusade against the largest toy manufacturer, Toys R Us, where he persuaded the company to stop selling toy guns that appeared real or could be modified to look like a real weapon; and campaigned against MTV’s daytime and evening music format, calling on the cable music station to stop showing videos during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. that glorify violence. Since his campaign, MTV has publicly announced that they have made positive changes regarding the broadcast of music videos. Because he was so committed to making a difference in the lives of urban youth, Councilman James E. Davis founded a voluntary, not-for-profit organization called “Love Yourself” Stop the Violence, dedicated to instilling the message of self-love, self-respect, respect for our communities and partnership between communities and police departments across America.  The Stop the Violence events are attended by thousands of community residents and feature prominent and notable guests including three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Evander Holyfield; recording superstars Salt-N-Pepa and many more.  James Davis sought political office to put himself in a position to allocate resources to benefit the community.In recognition of his hard work and dedication, James Davis was featured in several local and national newspapers including The New York Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times and The Washington Post; as well as national cable network programs such as USA Live, The Maury Povich Show, Leeza and The Montell Williams Show, and offered his insightful wisdom on law enforcement and its effects on the relationship between communities and police departments on such programs as CNBC, CNN, BET and MSNBC.

The poorly maintained equipment that caused her death was not a unique condition; this incident brought to light the dangerous, substandard equipment that New Yorkers walk on every day. Motivated by their grief and the warning her death represented, the residents of the East Village united to lobby the city’s utilities to ensure these dangers would be eliminated. Jodie was extremely involved in her neighborhood, interacting with everyone while walking her dogs twice a day. Jodie is remembered, shortly after 9/11, walking to the firehouse to talk with the firemen and coming home hours later. These strong men were often crying as they told her, an empathetic member of the community, their stories. She was writing her dissertation on the subtypes of obsessive compulsive disorder in children. Shortly before her death, she had finished her first draft of a book written for children with the disorder. She worked for many years doing research at the Psychological Institute as well as working with special education children. She had already published an article that is now used in psychology textbooks on \"Unconditional Positive Regard\" as a therapeutic style, showing its effectiveness. She presented this article at a worldwide conference in Uruguay. She was also doing client therapy, one child’s family wrote recently \"With determination and kindness she helped us get through a rough period in our life… Phillip never warmed the same way to anyone else\".',\n",

       "  'reason': \"The only Staten Islander to win the Medal of Honor during World War II. He hailed from West Brighton.  Joseph F. Merrell made a made a gallant, 1-man attack against vastly superior enemy forces near Lohe, Germany. His unit, attempting a quick conquest of hostile hill positions that would open the route to Nuremberg before the enemy could organize his defense of that city, was pinned down by brutal fire from rifles, machine pistols, and 2 heavy machineguns. Entirely on his own initiative, Pvt. Merrell began a single-handed assault. He ran 100 yards through concentrated fire, barely escaping death at each stride, and at pointblank range engaged 4 German machine pistolmen with his rifle, killing all of them while their bullets ripped his uniform. As he started forward again, his rifle was smashed by a sniper's bullet, leaving him armed only with 3 grenades. But he did not hesitate. He zigzagged 200 yards through a hail of bullets to within 10 yards of the first machinegun, where he hurled 2 grenades and then rushed the position ready to fight with his bare hands if necessary. In the emplacement he seized a Luger pistol and killed what Germans had survived the grenade blast. Rearmed, he crawled toward the second machinegun located 30 yards away, killing 4 Germans in camouflaged foxholes on the way, but himself receiving a critical wound in the abdomen. And yet he went on, staggering, bleeding, disregarding bullets which tore through the folds of his clothing and glanced off his helmet. He threw his last grenade into the machinegun nest and stumbled on to wipe out the crew. He had completed this self-appointed task when a machine pistol burst killed him instantly. In his spectacular 1-man attack Pvt. Merrell killed 6 Germans in the first machinegun emplacement, 7 in the next, and an additional 10 infantrymen who were astride his path to the weapons which would have decimated his unit had he not assumed the burden of the assault and stormed the enemy positions with utter fearlessness, intrepidity of the highest order, and a willingness to sacrifice his own life so that his comrades could go on to victory.\",\n",

       "  'reason': '\"I\\'m a personality as well as an actress,\" Katharine Hepburn once declared. \"Show me an actress who isn\\'t a personality, and you\\'ll show me a woman who isn\\'t a star.\" Hepburn\\'s bold, distinctive personality was apparent almost from birth. She inherited from her doctor father and suffragette mother her three most pronounced traits: an open and ever-expanding mind, a healthy body (maintained through constant rigorous exercise), and an inability to tell anything less than the truth. Hepburn was more a personality than an actress when she took the professional plunge after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1928; her first stage parts were bits, but she always attracted attention with her distinct New England accent and her bony, sturdy frame. The actress\\' outspokenness lost her more jobs than she received, but, in 1932, she finally scored on Broadway with the starring role in The Warrior\\'s Husband. She didn\\'t want to sign the film contract offered her by RKO, so she made several \"impossible\" demands concerning salary and choice of scripts. The studios agreed to her terms, and, in 1932, she made her film debut opposite John Barrymore in A Bill of Divorcement (despite legends to the contrary, the stars got along quite well). Critical reaction to Hepburn\\'s first film set the tone for the next decade: Some thought that she was the freshest and most original actress in Hollywood, while others were irritated by her mannerisms and \"artificial\" speech patterns. For her third film, Morning Glory (1933), Hepburn won the first of her four Oscars. But despite initial good response to her films, Hepburn lost a lot of popularity during her RKO stay because of her refusal to play the \"Hollywood game.\" She dressed in unfashionable slacks and paraded about without makeup; refused to pose for pinup pictures, give autographs, or grant interviews; and avoided mingling with her co-workers. As stories of her arrogance and self-absorption leaked out, moviegoers responded by staying away from her films. The fact that Hepburn was a thoroughly dedicated professional -- letter-perfect in lines, completely prepared and researched in her roles, the first to arrive to the set each day and the last to leave each evening -- didn\\'t matter in those days, when style superseded substance. Briefly returning to Broadway in 1933\\'s The Lake, Hepburn received devastating reviews from the same critics who found her personality so bracing in The Warrior\\'s Husband. The grosses on her RKO films diminished with each release -- understandably so, since many of them (Break of Hearts [1935], Mary of Scotland [1936]) were not very good. She reclaimed the support of RKO executives after appearing in the moneymaking Alice Adams (1935) -- only to lose it again by insisting upon starring in Sylvia Scarlett (1936), a curious exercise in sexual ambiguity that lost a fortune. Efforts to \"humanize\" the haughty Hepburn personality in Stage Door (1937) and the delightful Bringing Up Baby (1938) came too late; in 1938, she was deemed \"box-office poison\" by an influential exhibitor\\'s publication. Hepburn\\'s career might have ended then and there, but she hadn\\'t been raised to be a quitter. She went back to Broadway in 1938 with a part written especially for her in Philip Barry\\'s The Philadelphia Story. Certain of a hit, she bought the film rights to the play; thus, when it ended up a success, she was able to negotiate her way back into Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Produced by MGM in 1940, the film version was a box-office triumph, and Hepburn had beaten the \"poison\" label. In her next MGM film, Woman of the Year (1942), Hepburn co-starred with Spencer Tracy, a copacetic teaming that endured both professionally and personally until Tracy\\'s death in 1967. After several years of off-and-on films, Hepburn scored another success with 1951\\'s The African Queen, marking her switch from youngish sophisticates to middle-aged character leads. After 1962\\'s Long Day\\'s Journey Into Night, Hepburn withdrew from performing for nearly five years, devoting her attention to her ailing friend and lover Tracy. She made the last of her eight screen appearances with Tracy in Guess Who\\'s Coming to Dinner (1967), which also featured her niece Katharine Houghton. Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, and her third the following year for A Lion in Winter; the fourth was bestowed 13 years later for On Golden Pond (1981). When she came back to Broadway for the 1969 musical Coco, Hepburn proved that the years had not mellowed her; she readily agreed to preface her first speech with a then-shocking profanity, and, during one performance, she abruptly dropped character to chew out an audience member for taking flash pictures. Hepburn made the first of her several television movies in 1975, co-starring with Sir Laurence Olivier in Love Among the Ruins -- and winning an Emmy award, as well. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1976\\'s A Matter of Gravity. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hepburn continued to star on TV and in films, announcing on each occasion that it would be her last performance. She also began writing books and magazine articles, each of them an extension of her personality: self-centered, well-organized, succinct, and brutally frank (especially regarding herself). While she remained a staunch advocate of physical fitness, Hepburn was plagued by a progressive neurological disease which caused her head to shake uncontrollably -- an affliction she blithely incorporated into her screen characters. In 1994, Warren Beatty coaxed Hepburn out of her latest retirement to appear as his aristocratic grand-aunt in Love Affair. Though appearing frailer than usual, Katharine Hepburn was in complete control of herself and her craft, totally dominating her brief scenes. And into her nineties and on the threshold of her tenth decade, Katharine Hepburn remained the consummate personality, actress, and star.On June 29, 2003 Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes in Old Saybrook, Connetticut. She was 96.  Biography by Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide, Yahoo! Movies.',\n",

       "  'reason': 'Irving Berlin wrote \"Alexander\\'s Ragtime Band\" for the first Friars Frolic in 1911. George M. Cohan wrote \"Over There\" at the Clubhouse. Victor Herbert wrote and sang his \"Here\\'s To the Friars\" for his Testimonial Dinner in 1907. For a century the Friars Club has seen itself grow from a meeting in 1904 of the Press Agents Association at Browne\\'s Chop House, to the most prestigious entertainment organization in the world. Its history, steeped in show business tradition, has been written through such exalted events as its Testimonial Dinners, Roasts and Friars Frolics.Through the early leadership of Abbot George M. Cohan and the dedication of personalities such as Victor Herbert and Enrico Caruso, the Friars Club established itself in the early part of the century as a leading force in the entertainment world.From its early headquarters known as the Hermitage, located at 107 West 45th St. (1908-1916) the Friars congregated both informally and at orchestrated tributes honoring the celebrities and personalities of the day.Oscar Hammerstein, in 1908, was among the first to be honored with a Testimonial Dinner and in 1911 Abbot Cohan, along with Will Rogers, Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert and his orchestra, assembled a star studded cast for the first Friars Frolics. The Frolics were known the world over and brought the music and comedy of the Friars to theaters throughout the country. The proceeds from the Frolics enabled the Friars, in 1916, to build new and larger facilities at 106 West 48th Street where they continued to hold in-house galas, resplendent in sophistication, rich in music, and overflowing with acerbic comedy. As early as 1910, the Friars were noted for their \"roasting\" techniques, \"When a man subjects himself to being honored at the hands of the Friars, he needs a steel corselet to repel the jabs of his kidders,\" quoted a New York Tribune review of the Testimonial Dinner in honor of theatrical manager, William Harris. In 1932 the depression, coupled with the westward movement of the entertainment industry, forced the Friars into some lean years. They lost the 48th Street building and, in an effort to keep their ranks united, relocated first to the Lindy\\'s building then the Edison Hotel. In 1948, with the Friars membership fortified and the entertainment never diminishing, Abbot Milton Berle located the Club to 128 West 56th Street and finally, in 1957, to its current home at 57 East 55th Street.In 1988 the Friars welcomed women to join the formerly all-male bastion. Liza Minnelli became the first official female Friar and through the years their ranks have grown steadily among the Membership.When people think of the Friars Club they may think of its Testimonial Dinners, its Roasts, its Frolics, its comedians, its charities, its history whatever the context, it is undeniably unique.It is the Friars heritage which has enabled it to flourish to this day and continues to stand as a tribute to those early leaders. Cohan, Herbert, Berlin, Rogers, Caruso and so many others brought the entertainment community  together and did what they did best entertained. Today, almost one hundred years after that first gathering, Friars still get together to do what they do best, honor the tradition of the Friars motto, first penned in 1907, Prae Omnia Fraternitas, \"Before all things, Brotherhood.\"',\n",
