American Veterans Memorial Pier,Bay Ridge Avenue,Bay Ridge Avenue from Shore Road to the Pierhead Line,,"The 593-foot long 69th Street Pier, at the foot of Bay Ridge Avenue, was built in 1904 and was originally utilized as a ferry wharf and fishing pier. During World War I and World War II, nearby Fort Hamilton was used as a staging area for American troops who were to be shipped overseas to Europe and Asia. The 69th Street Pier, because of its proximity to Fort Hamilton, became an important embarkation point for these soldiers. When the wars ended, many of the returning soldiers reentered the United States by landing at the 69th Street Pier. It was here that they were welcomed home, honored and thanked for their service. For many, this pier was their first sight of American land upon returning home from their tours of duty.
During peacetime, the pier remained a ferry wharf, for traffic to Staten Island, until the Verrazano Narrows Bridge was opened in 1964. Afterwards, it fell into disuse, and disrepair, and was for a time fenced off and abandoned. In 2000, the pier was reconstructed and reopened as a recreation area. Community Board #10 recently unanimously approved and recommended a plan to rename the 69th Street Pier “American Veterans Memorial Pier” in honor of the many American soldiers who embarked and arrived there during World War I and World War II.

King Stephen of Hungary Way,East 82nd Street and York Avenue,East 82nd Street between York Avenue and Third Avenue,,"King Stephen was born Vajk, in 977 AD, son of Grand Prince Geza of the Magyars. Dedicated to the welfare of his people and committed to the strengthening of his people through intellectual and moral means, Geza invited Christian missionaries of the reform Benedictines from Cluny, France into his realm. As an example to his people, he had missionaries instruct his son and baptize him under the name Istvan or Stephen.
Stephen succeeded his father as Grand Prince of the Magyars in 997. Recognizing the energetic and responsible leadership of this young ruler on the eastern flank of Europe, Pope Sylvester II in 1000 granted Stephen the title of King of Hungary and sent papal emissaries to him with a crown symbolic of the new title and a double barred archbishop’s cross indicative of the establishment of a separate church organization for the newly independent nation. Since then, this crown and cross have become the radical confirmation of legitimate constitutional authority in Hungary and a rallying symbol of national identity and strength during the occupations of the Turks, the Austrians, the Nazis and the Soviets. The coronation of Stephen also focused Hungary toward the west.
Stephen organized the secular and religious life of Hungary in a manner which endures, with slight change, to the present. He invited foreigners, especially those who were refugees from oppression, into Hungary so that they could each enrich it with their customs, languages, and creativity. In this fashion, Stephen anticipated the “melting pot” concept of society, as we know it today. In his personal life, Stephen lived as an outstanding example of a husband and a father to such a extent that he and his son Prince Imre, or Emeric, were recognized as Catholic saints, and his wife, Queen Gesilla, was recognized as a Catholic blessed. Outstanding for his service to the poor and destitute and stalwart in using his political power for the defense of the powerless, Stephen shortly before he died, officially offered his crown to God as the only true ruler. 
December 20, 2000 marked the millennium of the coronation of Stephen as the first monarch of the Magyars (Hungarians). In recognition of this event, Pastors of the Hungarian churches of New York City have requested the permanent renaming of East 82nd Street, between York Avenue and Third Avenue, to “King Stephen of Hungary Way”.  This will include the East 82nd Street, between First and York Avenues, location of St. Stephen’s Hungarian Church.

Rev. Frederick Sutter and Rev. Carl Sutter Corner,Beach Street and St. Paul's Avenue,Beach Street and St. Paul's Avenue,,"Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter were a father and son team that helped to guide the fortunes of the Trinity Lutheran Church at the Stapleton community of Staten Island for more than 71 years.
Reverend Frederic Sutter, one of the first graduates of Wagner College (Rochester, NY), became pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in 1907. Shortly after his arrival, the congregation decided that a new church was needed. The responsibility of building the new church fell to Reverend Sutter. He guided the project into construction in 1913 and in 1914, the present edifice, an imposing Gothic structure of yellow brick located on Beach Street, was dedicated. Trinity Lutheran Church grew under Reverend Sutter’s leadership and by 1929 was believed to have 3,000 baptized members and 1100 communing members and probably had the largest Protestant membership on Staten Island at that time. 
Near the end of World War I, Reverend Sutter’s alma mater, Wagner College in Rochester, New York, reached out to him for help finding a new location for the school. Through his efforts, Wagner College relocated to Grymes Hill on Staten Island. Reverend Frederic Sutter was succeeded as pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in 1964 by his son, Reverend Carl Sutter, who had served under him for more than three decades.
Rev. Carl Sutter, known as “Pastor Carl”, was born in Hudson, New York and was brought to Staten Island, at seven months of age, when his father accepted the pastorate at Trinity Lutheran Church. He attended Public Schools 14 and 15 in Tompkinsville and Wagner Preparatory School. In 1929 he received a Bachelor’s degree in liberal arts from Wagner College. Carl Sutter then took a job on Wall Street while continuing his education at New York University Graduate School. After the stock market crashed later that year, Carl Sutter decided to leave the business world and follow in his father’s footsteps in the ministry. He enrolled at Princeton University and, a year later, transferred to his father’s alma mater, Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. Soon after his ordination in 1933 he returned to Staten Island to join his father at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was to spend his entire career as a clergyman there. In 1936, Dr. Sutter married his childhood sweetheart, the former Eleanor Koehler of Stapleton and moved to Emerson Hill.
Rev. Sutter was considered by many as a pioneer in improving community relations on Staten Island. He helped organize the Booker T. Washington Center during World War II to look after the needs of some 7000 African-American troops stationed in Stapleton who were denied access to the local United Service Organization (USO). Also during the War, Rev. Sutter, who was fluent in German, served as the chaplain for German prisoners of war at the former Halloran Hospital. He often played a key role in the Staten Island Interfaith relations, having served as chairman of the building committee for The nondenominational Bethel Community Church in Tompkinsville. Also, for several years, he orchestrated a series of Holy Week Services that brought together members of Protestant and Catholic churches in the Stapleton/Tompkinsville community.  Rev. Sutter served as president of the Staten Island Council of Churches and held a key position in what is now the Metropolitan Synod of the Lutheran Church of America. During the 1960’s, Rev. Sutter oversaw the construction of the $1,000,000 Trinity Lutheran School.  He delayed his retirement seven years, until 1978, to ensure that the debt on the school was paid in full.
Reverend Carl Sutter died in October 1998 at the age of 91. He was survived by two sons, Frederic and Carl Richard, three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Staten Island County Clerk Mario J. Esposito, who served on the Wagner College Board of Trustees with Reverend Carl Sutter for 12 years, said in an interview that he considered Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter the “backbone” of the College.  “Both were friendly, community-minded.  They set the standards and the goals. They were men of integrity.”  In recognition of their contributions to Wagner College, Trinity Lutheran Church, the Borough of Staten Island and the City of New York, it is fitting that the northeast corner of Beach Street and St. Paul‘s Avenue, the site of Trinity Lutheran Church, be named “Rev. Frederic and Rev. Carl Sutter Corner” in their honor.

Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians.
After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist.

After his discharge, Sal Candrilli worked for the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company and for Local 21, Staten Island before being hired by the New York City Department of Parks, where he retired after 35 years as a Mechanic Foreman in 1985.
He met and married, Ethel Young on April 10, 1948 and they had four children, Donald, Richard, Jerome and Missey, which is why his “love affair” of approximately 30 years, with Little League Baseball started.  Sal Candrilli began his Little League “career” as a coach with the Island Chevies. He also served as field Commissioner, umpire, and later, president of the Staten Island Little League in Dongan Hills, for approximately 17 years. He continued for another 13 years as District 24 Administrator for the National Little League Headquarters, overseeing leagues on Staten Island and in Manhattan.

On September 20, 1996 Salvatore Candrilli died. He was survived by his wife, the former Ethel Young; his children, a sister, Ann Pinto, and four grandchildren. His participation in organized sports on Staten Island made a difference for many people, including his grandchildren, Christina and Peter Candrilli and Nicole and Jennifer Vitagliano, who actively play in many organized sports on Staten Island. They have inherited his sportsmanship, respect for others on and off the field, and his true feelings for all kinds of sports, always remembering that he would say “it doesn’t make a difference if you win or lose but it’s how you play the game”. It is therefore fitting that Joyce Street between Naughton Avenue and Seaver Avenue, which abuts the Staten Island Little League complex, be named “Sal Candrilli Place” in his honor.

She died of complications due to AIDS on April 6, 1996 in New York City at the age of 53. Ms. Payan was famous for her portrayal of the villainous Carmen Delia on the Spanish-language television soap opera “Angelica, Mi Vida” and as a champion for anti-AIDS causes.
Long before Ms. Payan became an AIDS activist, she was active in the Latino community providing information about immigration issues.  She went to law school, was admitted to the bar in 1981, and went on to practice immigration law. She also became a contributing columnist for El Diario-La Prensa, the largest circulation Spanish-language newspaper in New York.

Juan Pablo Duarte Square,"West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway","West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway",,"Juan Pablo Duarte, born in the city of Santo Domingo on January 26, 1813, is considered the “Founding Father of the Dominican Republic”. He was the son of a Spanish merchant and, as a teenager, he was sent to Spain to continue his studies. During this time he was greatly influenced by Catalonia’s “autonomous community” goals. When he returned to Santo Domingo in 1838, he found that young Dominicans were resentful of Haitian rule. The Haitian domination of eastern portion of the island of Hispaniola had begun in 1822. The political unification of Hispaniola brought liberation to the slaves, land reforms, and political rights for all the people living on the eastern part of the island. Haitian domination made the Dominican people recognize the importance of self-government and political participation. Haitian law recognized political participation but Dominicans were actually considered a minority with few rights.
Is was in this atmosphere that Juan Pablo Duarte created a secret society, called “La Trinitaria”, in 1838 so that the yearning for liberty and self-government could be further intensified. He developed a political underground movement that organized the youth of the most important cities of the eastern part of Hispaniola. To promote their goals they used flyers, “cantaletas” (serenades with songs that had political content), and presented dramas with political content through a cultural organization called “La Filantropica”. This organization was open to all, promoted cultural activities and was controlled by “La Trinitaria”. In 1843, La Trinitaria worked together with the “Reformista” movement from the western part of the island to overthrow Jean Pierre Boyer’s Regime. Though this did not end Haitian rule, the situation made it possible for the La Trinitaria movement to gain political strength and to work in the open during elections.
Charles Herard, the leader of the Reformista movement and successor to Boyer, understood and mistrusted the political goals of the Trinitaria. After he was elected president in 1843 Herard persecuted the “La Trinitaria” movement and Duarte was forced to escape to Curacaco while his closest collaborators went into hiding. However, the movement toward independence continued to grow even with Duarte in exile. On February 27, 1844 the forces for independence issued a proclamation declaring the freedom of the Dominican Republic. Duarte returned and he immediately took charge of the army. This situation was short lived, however, for another political group that also promoted annexation took over the government and jailed Duarte. He was sent into exile within a year.
Duarte retired to an isolated village in Venezuela and remained away from his country for twenty years. In 1861, Spain took over the Dominican Republic and made it a colony. War broke out in 1863 against Spanish rule and Duarte returned the following year to fight again for Dominican Independence. He was sent on a diplomatic mission by the provisional Dominican government to solicit funding for the war from neighboring countries. After independence was reestablished he returned to Venezuela. He died there in 1876, having devoted his entire life to the independence of the Dominican Republic. In recognition of his leadership in the independence movement of his country it is fitting that the northern side of West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway, in the heart of one of New York’s largest Dominican communities, be called “Juan Pablo Duarte Square.”  The naming of this “Square”, located at the end of the previously named “Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard”, will provide space to erect a monument to Duarte as a symbol of  “democracy and freedom”.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines Boulevard,Rogers Avenue and Eastern Parkway,Rogers Avenue Between Farragut Road and Eastern Parkway,,"Jean-Jacques Dessalines is one of the founding fathers of Haiti, having taken charge of the Haitian Revolution to victory in defeating the French Napoleon Army in 1804.  Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776.   Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world.  More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present:  the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean.  By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname “the Tiger” for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794.  From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue.  
After Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue.  Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning.  By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation.
The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa.  Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter’s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America.  Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today’s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women.  Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed “Dessalines”; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (“La Dessalinienne”); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.
