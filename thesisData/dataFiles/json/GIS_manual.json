As an example to his people, he had missionaries instruct his son and baptize him under the name Istvan or Stephen.\nStephen succeeded his father as Grand Prince of the Magyars in 997. Recognizing the energetic and responsible leadership of this young ruler on the eastern flank of Europe, Pope Sylvester II in 1000 granted Stephen the title of King of Hungary and sent papal emissaries to him with a crown symbolic of the new title and a double barred archbishop\u2019s cross indicative of the establishment of a separate church organization for the newly independent nation. Since then, this crown and cross have become the radical confirmation of legitimate constitutional authority in Hungary and a rallying symbol of national identity and strength during the occupations of the Turks, the Austrians, the Nazis and the Soviets. The coronation of Stephen also focused Hungary toward the west.\nStephen organized the secular and religious life of Hungary in a manner which endures, with slight change, to the present.

Shortly after his arrival, the congregation decided that a new church was needed. The responsibility of building the new church fell to Reverend Sutter. He guided the project into construction in 1913 and in 1914, the present edifice, an imposing Gothic structure of yellow brick located on Beach Street, was dedicated. Trinity Lutheran Church grew under Reverend Sutter\u2019s leadership and by 1929 was believed to have 3,000 baptized members and 1100 communing members and probably had the largest Protestant membership on Staten Island at that time. \nNear the end of World War I, Reverend Sutter\u2019s alma mater, Wagner College in Rochester, New York, reached out to him for help finding a new location for the school. Through his efforts, Wagner College relocated to Grymes Hill on Staten Island.

Carl Sutter, known as \u201cPastor Carl\u201d, was born in Hudson, New York and was brought to Staten Island, at seven months of age, when his father accepted the pastorate at Trinity Lutheran Church. He attended Public Schools 14 and 15 in Tompkinsville and Wagner Preparatory School. In 1929 he received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal arts from Wagner College. Carl Sutter then took a job on Wall Street while continuing his education at New York University Graduate School. After the stock market crashed later that year, Carl Sutter decided to leave the business world and follow in his father\u2019s footsteps in the ministry. He enrolled at Princeton University and, a year later, transferred to his father\u2019s alma mater, Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. Soon after his ordination in 1933 he returned to Staten Island to join his father at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was to spend his entire career as a clergyman there. In 1936, Dr. Sutter married his childhood sweetheart, the former Eleanor Koehler of Stapleton and moved to Emerson Hill.\nRev. Sutter was considered by many as a pioneer in improving community relations on Staten Island. He helped organize the Booker T. Washington Center during World War II to look after the needs of some 7000 African-American troops stationed in Stapleton who were denied access to the local United Service Organization (USO). Also during the War, Rev. Sutter, who was fluent in German, served as the chaplain for German prisoners of war at the former Halloran Hospital. He often played a key role in the Staten Island Interfaith relations, having served as chairman of the building committee for The nondenominational Bethel Community Church in Tompkinsville. Also, for several years, he orchestrated a series of Holy Week Services that brought together members of Protestant and Catholic churches in the Stapleton/Tompkinsville community.  Rev. Sutter served as president of the Staten Island Council of Churches and held a key position in what is now the Metropolitan Synod of the Lutheran Church of America. During the 1960\u2019s, Rev. Sutter oversaw the construction of the $1,000,000 Trinity Lutheran School.  He delayed his retirement seven years, until 1978, to ensure that the debt on the school was paid in full.\nReverend Carl Sutter died in October 1998 at the age of 91.

He was the son of a Spanish merchant and, as a teenager, he was sent to Spain to continue his studies. During this time he was greatly influenced by Catalonia\u2019s \u201cautonomous community\u201d goals. When he returned to Santo Domingo in 1838, he found that young Dominicans were resentful of Haitian rule. The Haitian domination of eastern portion of the island of Hispaniola had begun in 1822. The political unification of Hispaniola brought liberation to the slaves, land reforms, and political rights for all the people living on the eastern part of the island. Haitian domination made the Dominican people recognize the importance of self-government and political participation. Haitian law recognized political participation but Dominicans were actually considered a minority with few rights.\nIs was in this atmosphere that Juan Pablo Duarte created a secret society, called \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d, in 1838 so that the yearning for liberty and self-government could be further intensified. He developed a political underground movement that organized the youth of the most important cities of the eastern part of Hispaniola. To promote their goals they used flyers, \u201ccantaletas\u201d (serenades with songs that had political content), and presented dramas with political content through a cultural organization called \u201cLa Filantropica\u201d. This organization was open to all, promoted cultural activities and was controlled by \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d. In 1843, La Trinitaria worked together with the \u201cReformista\u201d movement from the western part of the island to overthrow Jean Pierre Boyer\u2019s Regime. Though this did not end Haitian rule, the situation made it possible for the La Trinitaria movement to gain political strength and to work in the open during elections.\nCharles Herard, the leader of the Reformista movement and successor to Boyer, understood and mistrusted the political goals of the Trinitaria. After he was elected president in 1843 Herard persecuted the \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d movement and Duarte was forced to escape to Curacaco while his closest collaborators went into hiding. However, the movement toward independence continued to grow even with Duarte in exile. On February 27, 1844 the forces for independence issued a proclamation declaring the freedom of the Dominican Republic. Duarte returned and he immediately took charge of the army. This situation was short lived, however, for another political group that also promoted annexation took over the government and jailed Duarte. He was sent into exile within a year.\nDuarte retired to an isolated village in Venezuela and remained away from his country for twenty years. In 1861, Spain took over the Dominican Republic and made it a colony. War broke out in 1863 against Spanish rule and Duarte returned the following year to fight again for Dominican Independence. He was sent on a diplomatic mission by the provisional Dominican government to solicit funding for the war from neighboring countries. After independence was reestablished he returned to Venezuela. He died there in 1876, having devoted his entire life to the independence of the Dominican Republic. In recognition of his leadership in the independence movement of his country it is fitting that the northern side of West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway, in the heart of one of New York\u2019s largest Dominican communities, be called \u201cJuan Pablo Duarte Square.\u201d  The naming of this \u201cSquare\u201d, located at the end of the previously named \u201cJuan Pablo Duarte Boulevard\u201d, will provide space to erect a monument to Duarte as a symbol of  \u201cdemocracy and freedom\u201d.\n", "year": "2001"}, {"id": "200142", "coname": "Met Life Plaza", "location": "Bridge Plaza North, between 27th Street and 28th Street", "lat": 40.8555829, "long": -73.9687643, "borough": null, "loc_result": "Bridge Plaza N, Fort Lee, NJ 07024, USA", "postal": "07024", "reason": "The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is consolidating and relocating a substantial portion of its New York City operations from its space at One Madison Avenue in Manhattan to Long Island City.

Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776.   Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world.  More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present:  the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean.  By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname \u201cthe Tiger\u201d for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794.  From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue.  \nAfter Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue.  Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning.  By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation.\nThe independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa.  Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter\u2019s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America.  Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today\u2019s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women.  Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed \u201cDessalines\u201d; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (\u201cLa Dessalinienne\u201d); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.\n", "year": "2018"}]
