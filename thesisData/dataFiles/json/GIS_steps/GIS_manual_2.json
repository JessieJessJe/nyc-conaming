It is located at http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/jan-june02/poverty_5-06.html. In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. \"I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it.\" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies. The '60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America's cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown's Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground. His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown's Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, \"which is still finding Claude Browns,\" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared. Claude Brown's story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the \"cycle of poverty,\" they said, for the \"urban underclass,\" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope. Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone's payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land.

He won the World Heavyweight Boxing championship three times, and won the North American Boxing Federation championship as well as an Olympic gold medal.  He was born in Louisville, Kentucky and was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., but later changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam and subsequently converted to Sunni Islam in 1975.  In Louisville, October 29, 1960, he won his first professional fight winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker, who was the police chief of Fayetteville, West Virginia.  He went on to later retire with a boxing record of 61 bouts with 56 wins (37 KOs), 5 losses (1 Kos) and 0 draws fighting some of the most exciting bouts in boxing history.  In 1964, Ali failed the Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were subpar, however, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified 1A.  He refused to serve in the United States Army during the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector.  This and his affiliation with the Nation of Islam made him a controversial and popular figure in history.  Near the end of 1967, he was stripped of his title by the professional boxing commission and would not be allowed to fight professionally for more than three years. He was also convicted for refusing induction into the army and sentenced to five years in prison.   In 1970, he was allowed to fight again, and in late 1971 the Supreme Court reversed his conviction.  He went on to fight Joe Frazer and George Foreman in what is arguably considered some of the best fights in boxing history.   He was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in the early 1980s causing his motor functions to decline.  Despite his disability, he remained a beloved and active public figure.  In 1985, he served as a guest referee at the inaugural WrestleMania event.  In 1987, he was selected by the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution to personify the vitality of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights in various high profile activities and rode on a float at the 1988 Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the United States Constitution\u2019s 200th birthday commemoration.  He received a Spirit of America Award calling him the most recognized American in the world and in 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.
