It was under the tenure of the society's first president Joseph A. Palma (1903-1914) that the organization purchased land and erected a meeting hall on White Plains Avenue between St. Mary's Avenue, and Amity Street in Rosebank, Staten Island.In 1937, Vito Russo, and 46 other members of the Society, built a shrine honoring Our Lady of Mount Carmel, on Amity Street around the corner from Mount Carmel Hall.  The serpentine grotto is built out of stone blocks, brick, and cement.  It has a central chapel housing a statue of Our Lady of Mt.  Carmel, which is flanked by two wings.  The grotto's surface is decorated with stones, shells, bicycle reflectors, marbles, and glass flowers inlaid in cement in a variety of shapes such as ovals, diamonds, crosses, and stars.  Niches and shelves hold a host of Catholic saints such as St.  Jude, St.  Anthony of Pauda, St.  Anne, St.  Lucy, and others.  Vito Russo acted as custodian to this property until his death in 1954.In 2001, the property where the Our Lady of Mount Carmel’s Grotto and Meeting Hall stands was placed on the New York and National Registers of Historic Places.

From activation through V-E day and beyond, the 100th was commanded by Major General Withers A. Burress, and was thus one of only 11 U.S. Army divisions to be led by the same commanding general throughout the Second World War.The Division went into combat in early November 1944 as part of the U.S. Seventh Army’s VI Corps, with the mission of penetrating the German Winter Line in the High Vosges Mountains on the edge of the oft-disputed province of Alsace.  In the brutal fighting that ensued, the division stubbornly resisted all attempts at envelopment, and despite heavy casualties, the 100th completely disrupted the German offensive.  Ultimately, the 100th Division captured the Citadel of Bitche in March 1945 and passed through the Siegfreid Line into Germany.In all, in 185 days of uninterrupted ground combat, the 100th Infantry Division liberated and captured over 400 cities, towns and villages, defeated major elements of eight German divisions, and took 13, 351 prisoners.  In doing so, it sustained 916 soldiers killed in action, 3,656 wounded and lost 180 men missing in action.

2003313,Manchild Way,Frederick Douglas between 145th Street,"This information is taken from an essay by Clarence Page.  It is located at http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/jan-june02/poverty_5-06.html. In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. ""I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it."" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies. The '60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America's cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown's Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground. His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown's Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, ""which is still finding Claude Browns,"" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared. Claude Brown's story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the ""cycle of poverty,"" they said, for the ""urban underclass,"" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope. Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone's payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land. ",2003
