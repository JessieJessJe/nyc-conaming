Over the past half century, the Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club has been assisting recent immigrants adjust to life in America, and helping support Italian culture in Brooklyn.The Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club has contributed to Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and the City of New York in many ways. The club had a seat on the New York City anti-poverty council and New York City Partnership during the War on Poverty. It also helped organize community members to form the Carroll Gardens Association, which for the past 40 years has worked throughout Brooklyn to preserve communities and prevent the deterioration of neighborhoods through affordable housing development, property management, economic revitalization, and outreach and advocacy programs.Additionally, the Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club has also joined in planting trees and greening Carroll Gardens for decades.  On top of the contributions of the club as a whole, many members of the Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club have made outstanding contributions to Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn and the City of New York. Social club member Michael Pesce represented Carroll Gardens and the surrounding neighborhoods in the New York State Assembly, and is now a judge on the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club also included four young members who were killed in the attacks on September 11, 2001: Joseph Agnello, Grace Galente, Danny Pesce, and Dominick Berardi.", "year": "2011", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}, {"id": "20037", "coname": "Frances A.

After graduating from St. Francis Prep in 1948, he entered the Franciscan Brothers, taking the name Brother Ralph on August 18, 1948.  He was professed on August 19, 1949. Brother Ralph received a BS degree from Fordham University and a MS degree from St. John\u2019s University.  In 1997, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from St. Francis College.  He taught at St. Francis Xavier and Our Lady of Good Counsel schools in Brooklyn and St. Joseph\u2019s in Babylon, Long Island.  He was principal of St. Brigid\u2019s Elementary School from 1961-1967.  He was appointed assistant principal of St. Francis Prep in 1967.  Bro. Ralph served as a member of the Board of Trustees for over 30 years at St. Francis College.Bro. Ralph changed every single student\u2019s life by just standing outside and talking to students.  He did not just talk to them about how they liked Prep, but he took the time to talk and listen to the students about their life or any problems they were having.  He always asked everyone how they were doing before he would ever talk about himself, which he rarely ever did. Brother Ralph Clifford died on November 30, 2002 from post-operative complications. On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 A.M.  American Airlines Flight 11, a jet carrying 92 passengers that was hijacked on a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center.  The impact of the jet tore a huge hole in the building and set it afire, trapping hundreds of people on the upper floors.  At 9:03 A.M.  a second hijacked jet airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, with 65 passengers also out of Boston, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.  The plane exploded causing a fire that trapped everyone in the building who was above the point of impact.  Within the next ninety minutes both towers collapsed.Despite the heroic efforts of New York City\u2019s Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Services Unit, and hundreds of civilians, more than 2,800 people were killed when the World Trade Center came down.  Included among the casualties were firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, airline passengers and crewmembers, those who worked or had business in the World Trade Center, and civilians on the ground.  It is the view of the New York City Council, and millions of Americans, that all of the people who lost their lives in this terrorist attack are heroes as well as victims.  Today we celebrate their lives and mourn their passing by naming the following streets in honor of those heroes.  While honoring them, we also acknowledge that it is but a modest gesture when compared to their great and ultimate sacrifice.  This is the sixth piece of legislation that the Council has considered to rename streets and other public places in their honor.  The following forty-two sections of the bill are to honor these individuals.", "year": "2004", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}, {"id": "200454", "coname": "Lisa King Johnson Promenade", "location": "none the intersection of Beach 124th Street and the Boardwalk", "lat": 40.5782516, "long": -73.8442605, "borough": "Queens", "loc_result": "Beach 124th St, Queens, NY 11694, USA", "postal": "11694", "reason": "In honor of heroes and loved ones who were killed by the terrorist attack upon the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001", "year": "2004", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}, {"id": "200455", "coname": "Richie Allen's Way -- FDNY 9/11/01", "location": "none the Boardwalk and Beach 91st Street", "lat": 40.5867752, "long": -73.8146402, "borough": "Queens", "loc_result": "Beach 91st St, Queens, NY 11693, USA", "postal": "11693", "reason": "In honor of heroes and loved ones who were killed by the terrorist attack upon the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001", "year": "2004", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}, {"id": "200456", "coname": "Terence McShane Boulevard FDNY/NYPD", "location": "Beach 94th Street between Holland Avenue and Rockaway Beach Boulevard", "lat": 40.5859899, "long": -73.81657, "borough": "Queens", "loc_result": "Beach 94th St, Queens, NY 11693, USA", "postal": "11693", "reason": "In honor of heroes and loved ones who were killed by the terrorist attack upon the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001", "year": "2004", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}, {"id": "200457", "coname": "Leon W.

He also worked for the New York City Sanitation Department. He opened his first business in Williamsburg, Brooklyn called Driggs Pizzeria and Restaurant, where he made everyone feel welcome with his infectious personality, great food, music and atmosphere.

When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. \u201cOne night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,\u201d Magnus recalled. \u201cThank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.\u201d Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. \u201cI was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,\u201d Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps\u2019 services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank. ", "year": "2022", "group": 10, "keywords": ["September 11, 2001"]}]
