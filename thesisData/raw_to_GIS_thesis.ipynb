His hard working parents had come from Ireland looking for a better life, and settled in Rockaway to raise their family.Jack attended St. Francis DeSales in Belle Harbor, and Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn.  He then attended Manhattan College in the Bronx and moved on to the Academy of Aeronautics, across from LaGuardia Airport.  His education helped him in service as a Sergeant in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945.  He was an aircraft mechanic and trainer during the Second World War, and  proud of being chosen to guard President Harry Truman during a visit to New York.After the War, he married Ellen Hancock in November of 1947, and soon after purchased Fitzgerald’s Hotel on Beach 108th Street and Shore Front Parkway in Rockaway.  He served as a member of the Chamber of Commerce and a President of the Rockaway Rotary Club.  He loved serving his community, and taught this dedication to his four children.The stories about Jack Fitzgerald are part of the history of the Rockaways.  Jack had a great sense of humor, and always saw the best in people.  For instance, when a group of neighborhood teens broke into his business, he decided to give them a job rather than a police record.  He was the perfect example of the “it takes a village” philosophy.  He loved people and telling stories of his world travels; especially the story of meeting a person in Tokyo, Japan wearing one of his “Fitzgerald’s Tavern” tee shirts.   Jack sold Fitzgerald’s Hotel in 1982 and retired.  Jack moved from Rockaway in 1995 to be cared for by his children until his death on May 13, 2001 from Parkinson’s disease.', 'year': '2003'}\n",

Casella was born on October 5, 1950 in the Yorkville section of Manhattan.  David Casella attended St.  Joseph’s school in Manhattan, and began his studies for the priesthood at Cathedral Preparatory Seminary (then located in Manhattan).  He graduated from the former Cathedral College in Douglaston and St. Joseph’s Seminary in Dunwoodie.  He was ordained a priest for the New York Archdiocese on December 6, 1975.Following his ordination, he was assigned to St. Joseph’s parish on Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx, where he served as parochial vicar until 1985.  In September of 1985 he was named administrator of St. Thomas Aquinas parish, where he served until 1992.  Since 1987, he also served as chairman of Aquinas Housing Corporation, a community based organization that sponsors housing development, property management and social services.Father David Casella was appointed pastor of Our Lady of Angels Parish on Webb Avenue in the Bronx in July of 1992.  Fr. Casella brought to this parish a wonderful love of God and a tremendous desire to help all in need, Catholic or not.  He was a wonderful example of how to live the gospel and spread the Good News to all, regardless of religion, race or origin.Fr. Casella was instrumental in helping to develop and get funding for many youth programs, based from the parish school and throughout the neighborhood.  He helped to identify summer job opportunities for over 200 young people in 1996 and 1997.  He also sponsored a very active Scouting program serving over 150 young men and 75 young women and their families.Fr.

His family traveled to the United States when he was one year old and settled in San Francisco.  His mother, a professional singer, trained him in music and at age 7 first began learning the piano, then the violin at age 9.  He later studied for 3 years with Robert Pollack and for a few months with Louis Persinger.  He also studied until age 15 with Nahum Blinder, whom he considered his only true teacher.  He was later to say : “He taught me how to learn by myself, which is the most important thing a teacher can teach you.”  From this time on, Isaac stern became very interested in chamber music, already playing quartets and quintets with the principals of the San Francisco Orchestra.  At age 15, he performed J.  S.  Bach's Double Concerto on stage with his teacher.  The following year, in 1936, he played a Brahms concerto with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Monteux, then a Tchaikovsky concerto in Los Angeles under Otto Klemperer.  On October 11, 1937, he made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall, and appeared again in February 1939.  This new public appearance was hailed by enthusiastic critics, placing him at the forefront of musicians of his generation.  During World War II, he gave many concerts for the Armed Forces.In January 1943, Isaac Stern gave his first Carnegie Hall recital.  The following year, he appeared twice with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos.  In 1945, he made his first recordings for Columbia Records, and the following year, he was chosen by Hollywood to double the violin parts for the actor John Garfield in the movie “Humoresque.”  Thereafter, he went on to play with the greatest conductors,  Sir Thomas Beecham, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Bruno Walter, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein and George Szell.  He played the part of Eugène Ysaÿe in the film “Tonight We Sing,” relating the life of the great impresario Sol Hurok.

S.  Bach's death.  He again appeared with Casals during the following years in Perpignan and Prades, and a few years later at the Puerto Rico Festival.  His meeting with the famous cellist was a determinant influence and led him to devote part of his activity to chamber music, with Eugene Istomin, Alexander Schneider, William Primrose or Paul Tortelier.  In the early 1960s, he organized a trio with Eugene Istomin and Leonard Rose, which became extremely successful and toured widely until Rose's death in 1984.

On the other hand, he always refused to play in Germany, in memory of the atrocities committed under Nazi rule.  He had very strong ties with the State of Israel and collaborated assiduously with Israeli-American cultural centers and foundations, providing advice and support to young musicians in that country.  He played an important role as a pedagogue and mentor for such young Israeli virtuosi as Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Myriam Fried, Sergiu Luca and Shlomo Mintz.In addition to his activity as a violinist, Isaac Stern participated intensively in American musical life, making important contributions as music director for the National Council for the Arts.

By the time she reached her eleventh birthday her father had passed away from pneumonia.  She began cleaning apartments at age eleven to help her family make ends meet and became a forewoman in a dress factory at age seventeen.  Marion learned responsibility at an early age and she became the secondary income to her mother as the middle child of three girls.  Being an adept seamstress from her years in the factory, Marion would donate clothing she made to the poorer families from her church, Our Lady of Solace.  When her parish's school was unable to afford desperately needed maintenance, Marion organized fundraisers and bake sales to assist them in reaching their goals.  During World War II, she worked making army field jackets to help in the war effort and became politically and socially aware during that turbulent time.  Marion married in 1946 and she and  her husband raised three children, living behind a candy store, which they opened on Bath Avenue in the late 1950’s.  As a small candy store owner, working seven days a week, Marion still found the time to become manager for the local little league team. Marion's community awareness expanded to the political arena in the 1960's when she became Captain of the 16th  Republican Assembly District of Kings County.  She was also a Kings County committeewoman and worked as a troubleshooter during elections for her district.  In 1965, being the natural organizer that she was, Marion began the Cropsey Park Concert Series, which drew thousands for free rock music events.  Speeches by Abe Stark, Louis Lefkowitz and Dizzy Gillespie, became commonplace.  To this day, these concerts are still being enjoyed each summer at the park.  In 1967, she and her husband Phil opened up Bath Music, located in Bensonhurst, which she operated until her passing.  Marion became the heart of the music scene in her community.  She would open at any hour to help a musician in need.  She tried to instill the strong ethics she had into them.  She worked through many troubled times with them, helping many to get help for their drug or alcohol addictions.  Mama and Papa, as she and her husband were commonly known, also donated instruments to local schools, churches, charitable organizations, and even to the police marching band.  Although she was kind, she was not a pushover.  Standing just 4’11”, she disarmed a 6’1” bandit who had come to rob her, by knocking the gun out of his hand and kicking him to the ground.  This was chronicled in several local papers.Marion kept a community bulletin board in her store and would refer people in need to the proper City agency.  Children particularly moved her.  Any child in need became one of hers.  She helped to reunite a runaway, who was in a cult, with her parents.  She worked personally with mentally and emotionally challenged children from the neighborhood.  She worked to get them benefits, to have them removed from abusive households, and get them settled in community homes, or in some instances, apartments of their own.  She helped Chin and Leroy Chow for over 25 years, after their families abandoned them.  She was a lifesaver, literally.  A woman passing the store started screaming and panicking when she saw that her infant child had choked, stopped breathing, and was starting to turn blue.  Marion rushed to the carriage grabbed the baby by her feet and whacked her on the back, dislodging the blockage.  In countless cases, either running to help people in accidents on her busy avenue, assisting people fallen from epilepsy, or just coming to the aid of those who could not help themselves, Marion knew the solution to each problem was to get involved.Marion Castellano died on March 1, 2000.  Over a thousand people attended her wake and flowers overflowed four rooms and wrapped around the foyer of the funeral parlor.  The wake had to be extended an extra day and the funeral director at Miraglia Chapels exclaimed that in his thirty years he had never seen such an overwhelming amount of respect.  She was selfless throughout her life, and never looked for acknowledgement for her countless good deeds.  She was the backbone of her community.\", 'year': '2003'}\n",

J.A.  Lobbia, as she was better known, through her Village Voice column “Towers and Tenements,” tirelessly dug up information and pursued stories and leads that would show what was really going on for tenants in New York.  Lobbia’s journalism – and its incredible advocacy for the rights of tenants all over New York City – has had an immeasurable impact on our City.  It is for this lifetime of accomplishment that Manhattan Community Board No. 5 has approved naming a stretch of the bike lane on Sixth Avenue in her honor.When J.A. Lobbia went to work, she put her heart and soul into it.  Her “Towers and Tenements” column covered the City’s affordable housing crisis, the State’s weakening of rent regulation laws, the strident efforts of the tenants’ movements, and exposed the shameful ways of certain slumlords and developers. A true sign that someone really cares about an issue is his or her dedication, even after the workday is done.  When J.A. Lobbia would be biking through neighborhoods, she would take notice eviction notices and stop to give advice if she could.  She even noticed an eviction notice written in Chinese, had it translated so that she could read it, wrote a response, had it translated back into Chinese, and slipped it under the door.  Also, she actively volunteered her time at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, and as a tutor in the Immigrant Literacy Project of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart.For her efforts and diligent dedication to journalism, Lobbia received many awards.  Among these are the 2001 Front Page Award from the Newswomen’s Club of NY, Scales of Justice Media Award from Mobilization for Youth Legal Services, Best Columnist Award from the Society of Professional Journalism, and a Golden Typewriter Award for Public Interest in Journalism.J.A.

When she was sick, she was quoted as saying that when she died, she would want to be “buried in a dress and bike shoes.”  For a person who gave so much to the tenants of New York City, there seems no better tribute than naming a bike lane in her honor.

After the tragic death of his father, Paul lived with his grandmother in East Harlem.  Paul received his education in a Catholic elementary school and public high school.  At the age of 17, Paul’s grandmother passed away, leaving him to arrange sleeping in relatives and friends homes.  At one point, Paul stayed with Langston Hughes, where Paul Ramos learned about music and refined his taste in jazz and poetry.From 1960-1963, Paul worked at the Veterans Administration Hospital as an Operating Room Technician.  In 1964 he began work as a trainer at a management-engineering firm.  Because of his background in hospital work, he was assigned to monitor proprietary health institutions and related agencies that included nursing homes, private clinics and group practices.  In 1965 he began working for several Lower East Side community organizations, where he counseled “problem children” and obtained private funds for reading and tutoring programs.  He educated parents in health care delivery and how to avail themselves of the resources in the community.In 1966 he accepted a position in the Community Development and Education Department of the Gouverneur Health Services Program.  In this capacity, he monitored the delivery of health care to patients and organized a crisis intervention unit, focused on welfare, housing and relocation of families.  Paul devoted the rest of his life to the nurturing and growth of what is today the Betances Health Center, located at 80 Henry Street.  Paul Ramos worked tirelessly for over 30 years to promote health equity and to expand the quality of affordable health care for all in one of New York’s most diverse and underserved neighborhoods, the Lower East Side.As an early and active supporter of patient advocacy, he initiated local changes, which improved health care for the disadvantaged.  He developed the Betances Health Unit, a grassroots mobile health unit, into the state of the art community health care center.  This center has emerged through his vision into a proto-type for community health, one that continues its commitment to culturally respectful, compassionate care.In the early 1980’s, when HIV emerged, Paul’s infinite wisdom and compassion led Betances to the forefront as one of the first community health centers to begin to provide ongoing counseling, treatment and primary care to those living with HIV and AIDS.  For years, Paul was associated himself with the Lower East Side Task Force on AIDS, the Latino Commission on AIDS and the AIDS Service Center, of which he was the board chair until his untimely passing in May 2000.  His wife, four daughters and eleven grandchildren survived him.', 'year': '2003'}\n",

Born Jeffrey Hyman on May 19, 1951 in Forest Hills, Queens, the gawky geek decked out in sunglasses and black leather would found the Ramones in 1974, with friends Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy.  Each adopted the surname Ramone, after a stage name (Ramon) used by Paul McCartney during the earliest Beatles days.Best known for such two-minute anthems as “I Wanna Be Sedated,” “Blitzkrieg Bop” “Rockaway Beach” and “Teenage Lobotomy,” the Ramones are credited with founding what would later be dubbed “punk rock.”  According to legend, it was all an accident.  Novices on their instruments, the quartet knew four chords and played them at breakneck speed to prevent listeners from discerning the mistakes.  An average concert consisted of about three dozen songs in about 90 minutes.  Punk caught on and found a home at the downtown Manhattan club CBGBs, where the Ramones performed with like-minded souls Richard Hell, Patti Smith and Television.  After a Ramones tour in 1976, the genre spread to England, where the Sex Pistols and Damned copied what they saw but added a more rebellious edge.In 1979, the Ramones appeared in the Roger Corman movie Rock 'n' Roll High School, recording the title song for the soundtrack.  Ten years later they contributed the title track to Pet Cemetery, based on the book by Stephen King.  But mainstream crossover success consistently eluded them.  Although their fiercely delivered, wincingly inane pop songs about social misfits were hailed as rock classics, none ever cracked the Top 40.  The Ramones commercial profile consistently paled in comparison to each new generation of groups they inspired--from the Clash and Blondie, through the Offspring and Green Day (two of whose members named children after the Ramones) and now Blink-182 and Fenix TX.Over 22 years and several lineup changes the Ramones recorded 13 albums.  They released their last, “Adios Amigos,” and broke up in 1996, after performing a farewell show – their 2,263rd – with guests including Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.Joey Ramone died of lymphatic cancer on April 15, 2001, which he had been battling for about seven years.  He died in his hospital bed, and is said to have passed when U2’s “A Little While” concluded.  Not only was he the front man for his band, he was the front man of a generation of punk rockers.  More than any of his contemporaries, Joey Ramone was the figurehead for the New York punk scene that spawned many favorite bands.\", 'year': '2003'}\n",

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn.  At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system.A lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens high school a year ahead of her scheduled class.  Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism.  In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities.  Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper.  Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s University, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.Michelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education.  While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center.  There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children.  Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law.  In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former United States Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.After graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County.  While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond.  In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney’s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy.  Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community.  While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law.  Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard.  Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.Michelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing.  In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so.  A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published.  A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College fund.In 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer.  Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community.  Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer.  She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.On July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end.

When Cartier's son Alfred took over in 1874, the firm gradually began repairing and improving jewelry, and then designing and manufacturing their own original pieces in the late 1800’s. In 1899, the move to 13 Rue de la Paix situated the business in the heart of the important jewelry and couturier quarter of Paris.Encouraged by King Edward VII, Cartier opened a branch in London in 1902 managed by Alfred's son Jacques. A royal commission was granted in 1904, followed quickly by commissions from Spain, Portugal, Russia, Siam, and Greece. These royal commissions helped to solidify Cartier's reputation among the wealthy and famous the world over.To better deal with American millionaires, who from the beginning formed a large part of Cartier's clientele, a New York branch was opened in 1909 by Alfred's other son, Pierre. Until World War I, Cartier maintained close relations with clients in Russia, and the princes and maharajas of India sought Cartier to design and mount their jewels. Jewelry and accessories were also made as stock items for the stores or were commissioned by individuals.Until the 1960’s, the Paris, London, and New York branches were part of a single firm but operated independently, collaborating whenever necessary. In 1962, the New York branch was sold, followed by the Paris branch in 1965, thus ending the unity. The firm was reunited and reorganized in 1979 as Cartier Monde, and today shops and boutiques can be found in cities around the world.With each of the branches headed by a Cartier brother, the first four decades of the 20th century were a time of originality in design and technique in which a distinctive Cartier aesthetic emerged.  The name change is in recognition of the historic business relationship between the City of New York and Cartier Jewelers.  Pierre Cartier, the founder of the New York company for the Cartier family, lived on 52nd Street in the house where the business is now located.  The home was originally purchased with a Cartier necklace.\", 'year': '2003'}\n",

His community work began in Consuelo, Dominican Republic in 1951 helping the Catholic Church develop and organize the community. He  was involved in improving housing conditions, and providing family, sports and youth leadership programs. In 1966 he became a scout for the Houston Astros major league baseball team. ‘Jacobo’ as he was affectionately called, had to escape the Dominican Republic because of his involvement as a union organizer. He had to flee his country unexpectedly and leave his family behind. The government considered him a communist because he believed in the rights of people. He spoke against the government and organized the people in protests and job actions. He did not stand down to the government even thought it almost cost him his life. The Catholic Church helped him escape to Canada and later he immigrated to the United States.He came to the United States in 1970. Although he did not speak the language as well as the people in the community, the strength of his convictions prompted him to get involved with the people in his community almost immediately. He began by getting involved with sports via youth programs. He worked as a janitor for Saint Martin of Tours, a local Catholic Church that he asked to allow him to open the gymnasium to create a place where young people could go and play in order to be out of the streets. He was the president of the Crotona Community Coalition for 25 years. Under his leadership, the community was transformed. As a visionary leader, he believed that the family unit is the center of the community. Jacobo understood hat nurturing the family and its needs would have a positive impact on decreasing crime and violence in the community. Housing was a big issue. He first began to fight for rent control, heating of the buildings, and renovation of the apartments. Next, Jacobo redoubled his efforts to find places and activities to involve the youth, keep them away from drugs. As he expanded his vision, he and his staff had to explore external community organizations and people that would help them obtain their goals. The Coalition reached out to politicians, private and public industries and any one else who benefits from the community. Through his leadership and that of the Crotona Community Coalition, the community received a 3 million dollar grant from Mayor Koch and the organization was able to build its first ballpark and maintain a sports program. Through the years the community has built two more parks with additional grants obtained by the coalition under Jacobo's leadership. The Crotona Community Coalition also began to buy buildings and build affordable housing. One of his big dreams for the community was to build a community center. He was able to help create the community center called the Mary Mitchell Center, which has been open since 1998. This Center is the epitome of Jacobo's primary goal of keeping the youth off the streets and away from drugs.Jacobo always wore a green baseball cap, which become a symbol of his mission. As an authentic leader he had “the integrity to walk the talk and talk the walk, self-awareness of his feelings and actions, sensitivity and empathy toward and in relationship to the community”.

He was a great leader who served as a catalyst and voice for the American Civil Rights Movement. Born in Atlanta on January 15, 1929, he was the second child of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. A highly motivated child, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Morehouse College to study religion at age 15. He was a junior in college when he was ordained a minister and made the assistant pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church. In 1948, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Crozier Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he began to seriously study the life and work of Mohandas K. Ghandi. \"I came to see for the first time,\" King wrote, \"that the Christian doctrine of love, operating through the Ghandhian method of nonviolence, is one of the most potent weapons available to an oppressed people in the struggle for freedom.\" While working toward his doctorate degree in Systematic Theology at Boston University, Martin Luther King, Jr. met and married Coretta Scott. In May, 1954, he became the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Dr. King was thrust into the forefront when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man. Her courage triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott and created a citywide protest against local segregation laws. Dr. King organized the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and advised African-Americans to boycott buses and picket businesses who were in favor of segregation. In 1956, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\\'s bus segregation laws were unconstitutional. The victory established Dr. King as a national leader and paved the way for desegregation in other areas, most notably in public schools systems around the country. In 1957, Dr. King helped organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to end segregation using non-violent protests. He led numerous demonstrations against discrimination including rallies, sit-ins, the Freedom Rides and voter registration drives. The most memorable of demonstrations was the 1963 March on Washington where he delivered his famed \"I Have A Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. These efforts received international acclaim and recognition when Dr. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King through his powerful and sincere speeches, renewed the hopes, determination and spirit of all people seeking to improve their own lives. He inspired some to advance the principles of humanity nationwide and around the world. Dr. King\\'s last protest took place on March 28, 1968 when he led a march in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking sanitation workers. He was assassinated seven days later on April 4, while staying at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1985, President Reagan signed a proclamation declaring the third Monday in January a public holiday in honor of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ', 'year': '2003'}\n",

Then in 1914, a generous donation from Ms. Elvia Zabriskio enabled School Settlement to move to a facility built specifically for it at 120 Jackson Street, the site School Settlement inhabits to this day.Although the neighborhood has changed during the past century, the situation of educational deficiency Ms. Demonde encountered still exists.  School Settlement has proven itself over the past hundred years to be an asset to the Williamsburg/Greenpoint community by assisting in the education of the community’s youth.At present, the programs and services offered to School Settlement’s participants are designed to round out and supplement the education local youth receive in public school.  Homework help, arts and crafts, computer instruction, literacy and structured recreation are only a sample of the programs School Settlement offers.  School Settlement also offers an AIDP program under the CAPS initiative within Automotive High School as well as a teen night program on-site, designed to offer youth an opportunity to feel relaxed, have fun and express themselves in a smoke-free, drug free and violence free environment.School Settlement has been in the same community for over a century and in the same location for almost eighty years.

He went to work early and was only 14 when he became a warehouseman at the Morel meat packing warehouse at North 10th Street and Kent Avenue. He enlisted in the Army in 1937, and when his tour of duty was over in 1940 he went back to warehouse work. However, the United States entered World War II a year later and he was back in uniform again as a Combat Engineer. Nicholas was awarded the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action for risking his life to carry several officers to safety when they were thrown from a bridge that was being shelled.Returning to the Northside after the war, Nick briefly went back to warehouse work, passed the test for the Sanitation Department, and worked there for 30 years. He was honored for his valor at Sanitation also after he pulled a police officer from the flaming wreckage of his motorcycle.After returning from the service, Nick married his one and only love, Teresa, and they had a wonderful daughter. The love and support of his family gave Nick the strength to fight for his community. On his own time, Nick began helping community people get the things they needed to survive. He was the troubleshooter, complaints bureau and ombudsman for everything that touched people’s lives. In the early, years he would take people to the political clubhouse to get help there. Later on, he developed contacts directly to governmental offices and programs, although he never forgot the importance of political strength. Nick connected people and neighborhood institutions to the programs and services they needed.As vital as his help was to many people, Nick made his mark through larger issues. He led the fight against S&S Corrugated Paper Machinery when the City condemned 92 apartments to prevent S&S from moving its jobs elsewhere. Although the neighborhood fought to the last, many residents were dragged out of their homes while the bulldozers waited on the sidewalks, the houses were destroyed. In spite of this defeat, Nick and other community people had come together to form the Northside Community Development Council to fight for replacement housing, a senior citizens center and to make sure that nothing so destructive would ever again tear apart their neighborhood. Thirty years later, the Northside Community Development Council is still working to improve the environment. The Northside Senior Center is still providing services to our long-time neighbors. The homes on North 3rd Street and 4th Street are still strengthening the neighborhood.Nicholas Polonski died on April 20, 1999.

It is located at http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/jan-june02/poverty_5-06.html. In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. \"I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it.\" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies. The \\'60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America\\'s cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown\\'s Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground. His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown\\'s Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, \"which is still finding Claude Browns,\" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared. Claude Brown\\'s story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the \"cycle of poverty,\" they said, for the \"urban underclass,\" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope. Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone\\'s payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land. ', 'year': '2003'}\n",

A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress. Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city’s poor Santo Suárez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called “La hora del té” and with her mother’s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba.Cruz’s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers’ college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana’s National Conservatory of Music—but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career.Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Mantancera. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band’s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matencera disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950’s.At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz’s parents deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed.Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\", 'year': '2003'}\n",

The school offered art education to thousands of working class New Yorkers from 1923 to 1940. Several students won the prestigious Prix de Rome, and Isamu Noguchi received his early training at “The Leonardo”.The Piccirilli brothers kept a fairly low profile but were well known in certain circles. Virtually all the sculptors of their time visited the studio. Some worked there, and some actually lived there. The studio had become an important center for American art. Teddy Roosevelt, Enrico Caruso, and John D. Rocafeller also visited the studio. Fiorello LaGuardia was a close friend to the family for decades. “The Leonardo” received testimonials from Calvin Coolidge, Thomas Edison, Al Smith and many, many others.', 'year': '2003'}\n",

Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5.Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts.In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman\\'s cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister.Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason/Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet\\'s trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister\\'s family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York.By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves.With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman”, published in 1869, were a great financial help.In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis\\' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died, of pneumonia. She was 93 years old.', 'year': '2004'}\n",

In the process of struggling to overcome poor housing and working conditions, generations of immigrants have shaped, and continue to shape, the identity and development of the community.Named after heroes from the War of 1812, Allen and Pike Streets has long been an important corridor for immigrant settlement.  From the early 1800’s to the 1960’s, this thoroughfare was in a dense neighborhood of Eastern European Jews, Irish, Polish, Italian, and German Immigrants and African-American migrants.  Subsequent waves of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Chinese immigrant have expanded the cultural and economic vibrancy of the neighborhood.  The new “main streets” of Chinatown—East Broadway, Division, Canal, and Grand Street—cross Allen Street, making it the new central spine of Chinatown.The physical condition of Allen and Pike Streets, however, has fallen into disrepair.  The demolition of the elevated Second Avenue Subway and buildings along streets’ east side did not lead to the creation of a boulevard where neighborhood residents and visitors could come together for leisurely conversations, strolls and festivities.During an almost two-year community planning process to define a vision for Chinatown’s future (the Rebuild Chinatown initiative), Allen Street was identified by residents and merchants as an important community asset for the rich immigrant histories that it hold and the entrepreneurial, religious, and social activities that it sustains,  It has also become recognized for its potential to become a prominent boulevard that unifies the diverse immigrant groups living in Chinatown and the Lower East Side and a major connection to the waterfront that can be safely used by pedestrians and bicyclist.Hence, the idea to name Allen and Pike Streets, “Avenue of the Immigrants” and give immigrants of the past and the present the recognition they deserve.  The recognition is not only symbolic, however.  It is also intended to generate public and private investment into physical improvements that will transform this corridor into a real boulevard with a visible, multi-ethnic identity.', 'year': '2004'}\n",

The empty building was located on the south-east corner of West 122nd Street and Morningside Avenue, on the western boarder of Harlem.  That empty building was to become Church of the Master, Presbyterian.  It was a church building of gothic revival design and had been erected in 1894 as Morningside Presbyterian Church.  Around 1930, however, Harlem began bursting at the seams with the continuous arrival of African-American immigrants from the South and elsewhere.  Harlem residents began to move across northern Manhattan and into the predominantly white neighborhoods, around Morningside Church.  The struggle for territory was a furious one, and often erupted in violence, but by 1938, the congregation of the Morningside Church had become so depleted that the Presbytery of New York dissolved it.  From March to May 1938, the building sat empty.  James H. Robinson, who grew up in Knoxville, TN, would revive the building and create the Church of the Master.  From the moment he opened the doors in 1938 until he took a leave in 1959, the church was a whirl wing of activity.  The sermons he delivered were almost always very inspiring, educational and spiritually gratifying.  People from all over the world, at one time or another, were attracted to the Church.  In 1959, Rev. Robinson took a leave in order to raise money for a new building.  The Operation Crossroads Africa, however, required so much of his time that in 1961 he retired and became the Church’s first pastor emeritus.

He began to draw at age four, copying pictures from newspaper comic strips into a book of blank papers sewn together by his mother.  He was just a little older when he heard about Thipadeaux, a black artist who was teaching at the Police Athletic Academy in his neighborhood.  The teacher suggested that, rather than copying from other’s people’s work, he try to draw some of the real people in his neighborhood.  He began with his mother and aunt.  He later went on to draw the adults and the wary, diffident children he saw around him.  He attended Cartoonist and Illustrator’s School in NY (1951-1953) and also School of Visual Arts in NY (1956-1960).By 1961 Feelings finished art school with an extensive portfolio.  He tried to obtain freelance assignments but was often told by editors that he was limiting his chances by concentrating solely on black subjects.  By the mid 1970’s Feelings had illustrated six books, including a volume of diary extracts collected by Julius Lester, called To Be A Slave.  Shortly thereafter, he was asked to do ten color illustrations for a new edition of Booker T. Washington’s autobiography, Up from Slavery.  Despite the tragic subject, Feelings found himself continually painting pictures in warm and radiant colors that were quite inappropriate to such a project.  Knowing these pictures would convey a falsely positive image of slavery; he cancelled the contract.If the 1970’s had been a time of new experiences, the 1980s found Feelings firmly grasping the themes that had been germinating within his work since his youth in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  His autobiography, Black Pilgrimage, records a conversation with an eight-year-old girl that probed unforgettable for the artist.  Feelings tried to explain to her that his drawings were of “pretty little black children, like you.”  The young girl expressed her refusal to see anything beautiful about the black children, replying, “Ain’t nothin’ black pretty.”  Feeling’s lifelong dedication to the beauty of African people and their descendants graphically illustrates his inability to accept such a hateful attitude.If any man should be regarded as the personification of the “black is beautiful” philosophy, that man is Thomas Feelings.

He did not just talk to them about how they liked Prep, but he took the time to talk and listen to the students about their life or any problems they were having.  He always asked everyone how they were doing before he would ever talk about himself, which he rarely ever did. Brother Ralph Clifford died on November 30, 2002 from post-operative complications. On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 A.M.  American Airlines Flight 11, a jet carrying 92 passengers that was hijacked on a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center.  The impact of the jet tore a huge hole in the building and set it afire, trapping hundreds of people on the upper floors.  At 9:03 A.M.  a second hijacked jet airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, with 65 passengers also out of Boston, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.  The plane exploded causing a fire that trapped everyone in the building who was above the point of impact.  Within the next ninety minutes both towers collapsed.Despite the heroic efforts of New York City’s Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Services Unit, and hundreds of civilians, more than 2,800 people were killed when the World Trade Center came down.  Included among the casualties were firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, airline passengers and crewmembers, those who worked or had business in the World Trade Center, and civilians on the ground.  It is the view of the New York City Council, and millions of Americans, that all of the people who lost their lives in this terrorist attack are heroes as well as victims.  Today we celebrate their lives and mourn their passing by naming the following streets in honor of those heroes.  While honoring them, we also acknowledge that it is but a modest gesture when compared to their great and ultimate sacrifice.  This is the sixth piece of legislation that the Council has considered to rename streets and other public places in their honor.  The following forty-two sections of the bill are to honor these individuals.', 'year': '2004'}\n",

He was one of the first great American-born ballet masters and also a major Broadway and film choreographer, winning four Tony Awards and two Academy Awards. He was born Jerome Rabinowitz, October 11, 1918, son of Jewish immigrants. As a child he studied the piano and violin as well as dance. He studied ballet with Ula Duganova, Eugene Loring, and Anthony Tudor; modern dance with the New Dance League; interpretive dance with Sonya Robbins; Spanish dance with Helene Viola; and Oriental dance with Nimura, and in 1940 he joined American Ballet Theater as a dancer. In 1942 he choreographed his first ballet, Fancy Free , which recounts the adventures of three young sailors on leave. His style combined more popular dance styles with classical ballet in a way that was new at the time. In 1948 Balanchine invited him to join the newly created New York City Ballet, and in 1950 he received a Dance Magazine Award for his interpretation of Balanchine's Prodigal Son. From 1944 to 1964 he became famous beyond the world of ballet, choreographing for such Broadway musicals as On The Town, Peter Pan, The King and I, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof. It was perhaps with West Side Story , collaborating with Leonard Bernstein, that he reached the pinnacle of his show business career. His dances for the Sharks and the Jets captured the restless spirit and violence of gang warfare. Leaving Broadway behind him, he returned to ballet after 1964. In his career with City Ballet he created some 50 ballets that testify to the diversity of his talent and confirm his place as a 20th century ballet master. In Afternoon of a Faun, created in 1953, he demonstrated his command of the neo-classicism with this cool and mysterious reinventing of Nyjinski's ballet. The Concert created in 1956, is a comic spoof of a classical music concert. Many of his ballets like Dances at a Gathering, have become part of the repertory of companies around the world. After the death of Balanchine in 1983, he shared the post of artistic director of The New York City Ballet with Peter Martins until 1990. He was considered by the dancers as an uncompromising taskmaster. In 1981 he received a Kennedy Center Award. He returned briefly to Broadway in 1989 with an anthology of past hits entitled Jerome Robbin's Broadway. His dedication to dance will live on in his ballets. \", 'year': '2004'}\n",

After France abolished slavery in the territory in 1794, Toussaint supported the French rulers of the country against British invaders and was made a general in 1795. In 1801 he succeeded, after many struggles, in liberating Saint-Domingue from French control and became president for life of a new republic.

She inherited from her doctor father and suffragette mother her three most pronounced traits: an open and ever-expanding mind, a healthy body (maintained through constant rigorous exercise), and an inability to tell anything less than the truth. Hepburn was more a personality than an actress when she took the professional plunge after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1928; her first stage parts were bits, but she always attracted attention with her distinct New England accent and her bony, sturdy frame. The actress\\' outspokenness lost her more jobs than she received, but, in 1932, she finally scored on Broadway with the starring role in The Warrior\\'s Husband. She didn\\'t want to sign the film contract offered her by RKO, so she made several \"impossible\" demands concerning salary and choice of scripts. The studios agreed to her terms, and, in 1932, she made her film debut opposite John Barrymore in A Bill of Divorcement (despite legends to the contrary, the stars got along quite well). Critical reaction to Hepburn\\'s first film set the tone for the next decade: Some thought that she was the freshest and most original actress in Hollywood, while others were irritated by her mannerisms and \"artificial\" speech patterns. For her third film, Morning Glory (1933), Hepburn won the first of her four Oscars. But despite initial good response to her films, Hepburn lost a lot of popularity during her RKO stay because of her refusal to play the \"Hollywood game.\" She dressed in unfashionable slacks and paraded about without makeup; refused to pose for pinup pictures, give autographs, or grant interviews; and avoided mingling with her co-workers. As stories of her arrogance and self-absorption leaked out, moviegoers responded by staying away from her films. The fact that Hepburn was a thoroughly dedicated professional -- letter-perfect in lines, completely prepared and researched in her roles, the first to arrive to the set each day and the last to leave each evening -- didn\\'t matter in those days, when style superseded substance. Briefly returning to Broadway in 1933\\'s The Lake, Hepburn received devastating reviews from the same critics who found her personality so bracing in The Warrior\\'s Husband. The grosses on her RKO films diminished with each release -- understandably so, since many of them (Break of Hearts [1935], Mary of Scotland [1936]) were not very good. She reclaimed the support of RKO executives after appearing in the moneymaking Alice Adams (1935) -- only to lose it again by insisting upon starring in Sylvia Scarlett (1936), a curious exercise in sexual ambiguity that lost a fortune. Efforts to \"humanize\" the haughty Hepburn personality in Stage Door (1937) and the delightful Bringing Up Baby (1938) came too late; in 1938, she was deemed \"box-office poison\" by an influential exhibitor\\'s publication. Hepburn\\'s career might have ended then and there, but she hadn\\'t been raised to be a quitter. She went back to Broadway in 1938 with a part written especially for her in Philip Barry\\'s The Philadelphia Story. Certain of a hit, she bought the film rights to the play; thus, when it ended up a success, she was able to negotiate her way back into Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Produced by MGM in 1940, the film version was a box-office triumph, and Hepburn had beaten the \"poison\" label. In her next MGM film, Woman of the Year (1942), Hepburn co-starred with Spencer Tracy, a copacetic teaming that endured both professionally and personally until Tracy\\'s death in 1967. After several years of off-and-on films, Hepburn scored another success with 1951\\'s The African Queen, marking her switch from youngish sophisticates to middle-aged character leads. After 1962\\'s Long Day\\'s Journey Into Night, Hepburn withdrew from performing for nearly five years, devoting her attention to her ailing friend and lover Tracy. She made the last of her eight screen appearances with Tracy in Guess Who\\'s Coming to Dinner (1967), which also featured her niece Katharine Houghton. Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, and her third the following year for A Lion in Winter; the fourth was bestowed 13 years later for On Golden Pond (1981). When she came back to Broadway for the 1969 musical Coco, Hepburn proved that the years had not mellowed her; she readily agreed to preface her first speech with a then-shocking profanity, and, during one performance, she abruptly dropped character to chew out an audience member for taking flash pictures. Hepburn made the first of her several television movies in 1975, co-starring with Sir Laurence Olivier in Love Among the Ruins -- and winning an Emmy award, as well. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1976\\'s A Matter of Gravity. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hepburn continued to star on TV and in films, announcing on each occasion that it would be her last performance. She also began writing books and magazine articles, each of them an extension of her personality: self-centered, well-organized, succinct, and brutally frank (especially regarding herself). While she remained a staunch advocate of physical fitness, Hepburn was plagued by a progressive neurological disease which caused her head to shake uncontrollably -- an affliction she blithely incorporated into her screen characters. In 1994, Warren Beatty coaxed Hepburn out of her latest retirement to appear as his aristocratic grand-aunt in Love Affair. Though appearing frailer than usual, Katharine Hepburn was in complete control of herself and her craft, totally dominating her brief scenes. And into her nineties and on the threshold of her tenth decade, Katharine Hepburn remained the consummate personality, actress, and star.On June 29, 2003 Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes in Old Saybrook, Connetticut. She was 96.  Biography by Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide, Yahoo! Movies.', 'year': '2004'}\n",

George M. Cohan wrote \"Over There\" at the Clubhouse. Victor Herbert wrote and sang his \"Here\\'s To the Friars\" for his Testimonial Dinner in 1907. For a century the Friars Club has seen itself grow from a meeting in 1904 of the Press Agents Association at Browne\\'s Chop House, to the most prestigious entertainment organization in the world. Its history, steeped in show business tradition, has been written through such exalted events as its Testimonial Dinners, Roasts and Friars Frolics.Through the early leadership of Abbot George M. Cohan and the dedication of personalities such as Victor Herbert and Enrico Caruso, the Friars Club established itself in the early part of the century as a leading force in the entertainment world.From its early headquarters known as the Hermitage, located at 107 West 45th St. (1908-1916) the Friars congregated both informally and at orchestrated tributes honoring the celebrities and personalities of the day.Oscar Hammerstein, in 1908, was among the first to be honored with a Testimonial Dinner and in 1911 Abbot Cohan, along with Will Rogers, Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert and his orchestra, assembled a star studded cast for the first Friars Frolics. The Frolics were known the world over and brought the music and comedy of the Friars to theaters throughout the country. The proceeds from the Frolics enabled the Friars, in 1916, to build new and larger facilities at 106 West 48th Street where they continued to hold in-house galas, resplendent in sophistication, rich in music, and overflowing with acerbic comedy. As early as 1910, the Friars were noted for their \"roasting\" techniques, \"When a man subjects himself to being honored at the hands of the Friars, he needs a steel corselet to repel the jabs of his kidders,\" quoted a New York Tribune review of the Testimonial Dinner in honor of theatrical manager, William Harris. In 1932 the depression, coupled with the westward movement of the entertainment industry, forced the Friars into some lean years. They lost the 48th Street building and, in an effort to keep their ranks united, relocated first to the Lindy\\'s building then the Edison Hotel. In 1948, with the Friars membership fortified and the entertainment never diminishing, Abbot Milton Berle located the Club to 128 West 56th Street and finally, in 1957, to its current home at 57 East 55th Street.In 1988 the Friars welcomed women to join the formerly all-male bastion. Liza Minnelli became the first official female Friar and through the years their ranks have grown steadily among the Membership.When people think of the Friars Club they may think of its Testimonial Dinners, its Roasts, its Frolics, its comedians, its charities, its history whatever the context, it is undeniably unique.It is the Friars heritage which has enabled it to flourish to this day and continues to stand as a tribute to those early leaders. Cohan, Herbert, Berlin, Rogers, Caruso and so many others brought the entertainment community  together and did what they did best entertained. Today, almost one hundred years after that first gathering, Friars still get together to do what they do best, honor the tradition of the Friars motto, first penned in 1907, Prae Omnia Fraternitas, \"Before all things, Brotherhood.\"', 'year': '2004'}\n",

After a few weeks in the area, the captain decided to return to Holland, but Rodriguez refused, arguing he was a free man and warning that if he was forced to go on the ship he would jump overboard.  His Dutch captain accepted his demands and in payment for the work done as part of the ship’s crew, Rodriguez was compensated with a number of hatchets, presumably to trade them with the local Algonquian Amerindians.  The ship left with the entire crew for Holland leaving Rodriguez in the area.  The following year, 1614, another Dutch merchant ship arrived in the Hudson, found Rodriguez, and hired him to assist in trading with the local Amerindians.  Shortly afterwards, the same captain that had brought over Rodriguez as sailor in 1613, arrived for a second time on a ship in the Hudson. A dispute erupted between the two Dutch captains and crews over the primacy in the right to trade with the local Amerindians. Rodriguez himself was involved in the scuffle.  Once the crews were back in Holland, they took their contention to court and a notarial record was generated with their depositions about the past events in the Hudson.  These depositions, held at the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, became the only source known so far on the story of Juan Rodriguez. They were first published by Simon Hart in 1959 in his book The prehistory of the New Netherland Company. (Amsterdam: City of Amsterdam Press).  No other documents have been found about the life of Rodriguez after 1614.  Further research work in archival documents pertaining to Hispaniola in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conducted by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City College of New York have revealed the existence of a number of individuals with the name Juan Rodrigues or Rodriguez  (spelled indistinctly, with S or Z, in the Spanish documents) in the island-colony of Santo Domingo at the time, including three explicitly tried by the authorities for smuggling of goods with Dutch merchants in the island.  The historical record clearly shows Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez residing somewhere at the Hudson Bay area between 1613 and 1614.  As a result, Rodriguez is considered the first non-Amerindian person to ever have resided in what is today New York City.  The arrival of Juan Rodriguez in 1613 indicates that the Dominican/Latino population’s relationship with the second capital of the country, as New York is called, began many years ago and that those who left the country of origin afterwards merely followed the trail of Juan Rodriguez, first non-native man in residing in the city. A conclusive statement on the role played by Rodríguez is that in 1613 it had been expressly declared that no other member of the Dutch crew had stayed behind in the Hudson area.  This is confirmed by the documents found in the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, where the Dutch sailors declare that when the Dutch ship sailed away from the river, a mulatto born in Santo Domingo stayed ashore at the same place.', 'year': '2012'}\n",

In the 1951 World Series, Mays was part of the first all-African-America outfield in major league history along with Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin in game one of the series.

      "{'id': '201339', 'coname': 'Juan Rodriguez Way', 'loc_search': 'Broadway Between 159th Street and 218th Street', 'reason': 'Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez was a mulatto or Black man from Santo Domingo (the Spanish island-colony also known as La Española in Spanish and as Hispaniola in English) that arrived in the Hudson River Harbor in 1613 as part of the crew of a merchant Dutch ship exploring the area for its trade potential.  After a few weeks in the area, the captain decided to return to Holland, but Rodriguez refused, arguing he was a free man and warning that if he was forced to go on the ship he would jump overboard.  His Dutch captain accepted his demands and in payment for the work done as part of the ship’s crew, Rodriguez was compensated with a number of hatchets, presumably to trade them with the local Algonquian Amerindians.  The ship left with the entire crew for Holland leaving Rodriguez in the area.  The following year, 1614, another Dutch merchant ship arrived in the Hudson, found Rodriguez, and hired him to assist in trading with the local Amerindians.  Shortly afterwards, the same captain that had brought over Rodriguez as sailor in 1613, arrived for a second time on a ship in the Hudson. A dispute erupted between the two Dutch captains and crews over the primacy in the right to trade with the local Amerindians. Rodriguez himself was involved in the scuffle.  Once the crews were back in Holland, they took their contention to court and a notarial record was generated with their depositions about the past events in the Hudson.  These depositions, held at the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, became the only source known so far on the story of Juan Rodriguez. They were first published by Simon Hart in 1959 in his book The prehistory of the New Netherland Company. (Amsterdam: City of Amsterdam Press).  No other documents have been found about the life of Rodriguez after 1614.  Further research work in archival documents pertaining to Hispaniola in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conducted by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City College of New York have revealed the existence of a number of individuals with the name Juan Rodrigues or Rodriguez  (spelled indistinctly, with S or Z, in the Spanish documents) in the island-colony of Santo Domingo at the time, including three explicitly tried by the authorities for smuggling of goods with Dutch merchants in the island.  The historical record clearly shows Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez residing somewhere at the Hudson Bay area between 1613 and 1614.  As a result, Rodriguez is considered the first non-Amerindian person to ever have resided in what is today New York City.  The arrival of Juan Rodriguez in 1613 indicates that the Dominican/Latino population’s relationship with the second capital of the country, as New York is called, began many years ago and that those who left the country of origin afterwards merely followed the trail of Juan Rodriguez, first non-native man in residing in the city. A conclusive statement on the role played by Rodríguez is that in 1613 it had been expressly declared that no other member of the Dutch crew had stayed behind in the Hudson area.  This is confirmed by the documents found in the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, where the Dutch sailors declare that when the Dutch ship sailed away from the river, a mulatto born in Santo Domingo stayed ashore at the same place.', 'year': '2013'}\n",

He moved to New York in 1964 and soon started his campaign to help Soviet Jews.  He orchestrated the movement to free Soviet Jews with student demonstrations at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations beginning in 1964.  On April 27, 1964, in the Philosophy Hall on the Columbia University campus, around 200 students from Yeshiva University, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Queens College and Columbia gathered to plan the May Day protest.  The May Day protest consisted of a thousand young men and women, almost all Jewish, who answered his summons who marched silently in two neat rows for four hours in the conservative clothes they wore to synagogue.  Other demonstrations, some of which attracted as many as 3,000 protesters, were held on Jewish holidays and every rally included posters declaring “Let my people go,” the line from Exodus 9:1 that became the clarion call of the movement.  His demand was free emigration, not just an easing of restrictions.  He publicized the cases of individual Jews in Russia, despite mainstream organizations’ worries that this might endanger them.  He tried to expose Soviet anti-Semitism and hypocrisy, in the belief that Moscow was more sensitive to international opinion than many thought.  He lobbied Washington, and personally conveyed his support to Soviet “refuseniks” who protested being denied permission to emigrate.  His grass-roots movement contributed to legislation that eventually helped liberalize Moscow’s emigration policies, an issue that President Ronald Reagan personally pressed the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on.  As a result, more than 1.5 million Soviet Jews were allowed to move to Israel and elsewhere.   ', 'year': '2015'}\n",

In September of 2012, she launched her career as a NYC public school teacher after receiving her Masters of Education. She was teaching 10th grade Special Education students at the Bushwick School for Social Justice.

Born in North Carolina, she moved to New York City at age 22 in 1957. She was a founding member of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) and was elected as its chair multiple times. She served as a voice for her family, her community and every poor mother throughout the United States. During the Nixon administration, she and the NWRO were active in the face of new federal work requirements for welfare in the form of the Family Assistance Plan. During its time in Congress, she fought to get the voices of those on welfare, particularly those of urban mothers, heard to the senate committee members in charge of the legislation. The NWRO served as an incredibly powerful advocate for poor women and children to be collectively heard in government.  Sander’s tenure as chair of the NWRO coincided with one of the most active points of the NWRO’s existence as many conservatives looked to further restrict the extent of welfare within the United States. In New York City, she led a march of nearly 2,000 mothers through the rain to demand the city’s welfare commissioner provide the long awaited clothing vouchers for children before the school year started.  In 1967, when the clothing grants had stalled, she directly confronted Mayor John Lindsay with a press conference and occupation of the steps of City Hall. With these marches, she was able to garner significant media attention and use the newfound momentum to help launch the NWRO.  With support from labor groups, tenants organizations and anti-Vietnam activists, as well as a strong source of funding in the Community Action Program, she helped build and eventually became the chair of the largest welfare rights group throughout the entire United States with over 100,000 members.  She also attended numerous international peace conferences in war torn parts of the world, such as Vietnam.  In 1968, she became an educative force to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and along with the NWRO, provided him and his associates with a basic understanding of the welfare system. Welfare reform quickly became an integral part in the Poor People’s Campaign spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and provided a strong link between the civil rights and anti-poverty movements.

Born in North Carolina, she moved to New York City at age 22 in 1957. She was a founding member of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) and was elected as its chair multiple times. She served as a voice for her family, her community and every poor mother throughout the United States. During the Nixon administration, she and the NWRO were active in the face of new federal work requirements for welfare in the form of the Family Assistance Plan. During its time in Congress, she fought to get the voices of those on welfare, particularly those of urban mothers, heard to the senate committee members in charge of the legislation. The NWRO served as an incredibly powerful advocate for poor women and children to be collectively heard in government.  Sander’s tenure as chair of the NWRO coincided with one of the most active points of the NWRO’s existence as many conservatives looked to further restrict the extent of welfare within the United States. In New York City, she led a march of nearly 2,000 mothers through the rain to demand the city’s welfare commissioner provide the long awaited clothing vouchers for children before the school year started.  In 1967, when the clothing grants had stalled, she directly confronted Mayor John Lindsay with a press conference and occupation of the steps of City Hall. With these marches, she was able to garner significant media attention and use the newfound momentum to help launch the NWRO.  With support from labor groups, tenants organizations and anti-Vietnam activists, as well as a strong source of funding in the Community Action Program, she helped build and eventually became the chair of the largest welfare rights group throughout the entire United States with over 100,000 members.  She also attended numerous international peace conferences in war torn parts of the world, such as Vietnam.  In 1968, she became an educative force to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and along with the NWRO, provided him and his associates with a basic understanding of the welfare system. Welfare reform quickly became an integral part in the Poor People’s Campaign spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and provided a strong link between the civil rights and anti-poverty movements.

He changed the landscape and the soundscape of the community with his casita as the leading site on the mainland for Puerto Rican music. After years of gardening, taking care of the land, planting fruits and vegetables – grapes, peaches, cabbages, green peppers, tomatoes and more, he enjoyed distributing items to the community at no cost. The community still comes to pick fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden. In 1987, the Casita de Chema joined the city’s Green Thumb Community Garden Program.

However, Punjabi identity also included those who did not belong to any of the historical tribes. With the passage of time, tribal structures are coming to an end and are being replaced with a more cohesive and holistic society, as community building and group cohesiveness form the new pillars of Punjabi society. In relative contemporary terms, Punjabis can be referred to in three most common subgroups: Punjabi Muslims, Punjabi Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus. Due to political, social and economic factors a significant number of Punjabi Sikhs have immigrated to build their homes throughout the nation—particularly in the last three decades or so. Specifically, Richmond Hill, New York, has a high concentration of these immigrants and is a community that can be identified as a Punjabi Sikh enclave.

From 1972 the Richmond Hill gurdwara founded by the Sikh Cultural Society of New York welcomed Sikhs from the entire New York metropolitan area travelled there to attend religious services. The gurdwara offered meals, lodging and other services to visitors and to the continuing stream of Sikh immigrants. It served as a house of worship, community center and entry point to a new country. As increasing numbers of Sikh immigrants arrived in America the gurdwara continued to be the central focus for this community. Many of these immigrants found work in Richmond Hill and called this area home. Gurdwaras in the city of New York are seen as a religious cornerstone and beacons of hope. ', 'year': '2020'}\n",

After struggling with alcohol dependency for many years, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1980, an entity he considered his lifeline. Feeling welcome at AA, he invested himself into getting well. His faith, determination, and the AA community contributed to his success in reorganizing his life. In 1984, he contributed to the founding of the “Association of Merchants and Professionals in Support of the Dominican Liberation Party.” He became close to Professor Juan Bosch, the leader of the Dominican Liberation Party and participated avidly in both the domestic political arena in DR and New York City. He supported various grassroots political candidates, earning a reputation as a distinguished member of the community. In 2002, together with a handful of people, he decided to create the Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, with the mission of helping alcoholic patients and drug addicts who needed help but were afraid to seek it because of the stigma linked to mental health and substance abuse. Don Carlos, as he was affectionately called, cared deeply about those who helped and their families. He fought to change perceptions and systems that catalogued substance abuse patients as general psychiatry patients, managing that 8 New York hospitals assigned special facilities and targeted responses to care for them. After discharge, he found appropriate homes for participants and helped them join AA, where they had access to a support system as they started their journey towards sobriety. For Carlos, the work with Alcoholics Anonymous became his life mission. He was concerned with sponsoring and giving emotional support to many substance abuse patients. Saving lives for him was a duty and a mission. Not only was he an active member, he founded several AA chapters, mentored countless members, and shared his personal testimony to help others. In addition to his work in caring for substance abuse sufferers, Carlos Martínez invested his time and resources in development programs in the DR. He served as President of the famed Dominican “Club de Leones” chapter in Manhattan. He obtained a government grant to offer free prostate cancer early detection tests for those who could not afford it and he volunteered at Lincoln Hospital, where he campaigned to educate and spread information about prostate cancer.

At the 115th Street Library, she instituted bilingual story hours and implemented traditional Puerto Rican holidays into the Library’s schedule. In 1932, she published her first book, Pérez and Martina, which was a folk tale her grandmother used to tell her while in Puerto Rico. Pérez and Martina became the first Puerto Rican book to be read at story time in the Library’s history. As a librarian at the 115th Street Library, she metaphorically opened the doors of the Library to the Spanish speaking world. While she not only worked within the library system, she also helped compile the Archivo de Documentación Puertorriqueña, which collects original Puerto Rican documents. In 1940, she was invited to the ALA in Cincinnati, Ohio, to present a paper she wrote on working with the Spanish speaking community in East Harlem. She wrote The Three Magi which was published as a part of the anthology The Animals’ Christmas by Anne Thaxter. She compiled short stories titled The Tiger and the Rabbit and Other Tales.

A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress. Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city’s poor Santo Suárez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called “La hora del té” and with her mother’s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba. Cruz’s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers’ college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana’s National Conservatory of Music—but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career. Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Matancer. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band’s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matancer disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950’s. At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz’s parents’ deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed. Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\", 'year': '2022'}\n",

She passed away unexpectedly on June 11, 2021 as she went to bury her recently deceased mother in Guatemala. She left this world away from her beloved community of Jackson Heights, but surrounded by close family members. For over 40 years she passionately provided her talents and activism to her community of Jackson Heights where she served as a member of Queens Neighborhood Advisory Board #4 and the Community Action Board as the Representative of Region 17 for Queens NABs #3, #4 and #17. In 2019, The Department of Youth and Community Development, with New York City Community Action Board, awarded Monti Castañeda with a certificate of great appreciation for her efforts on behalf of those in need in her community and for passionately supporting the Community Action Program. Previously, she was a featured woman in El Diario’s 2016 Outstanding Women edition for her contributions to New York City in the area of public health. In 2012, The Ecuadorian International Center awarded her a Certificate of Recognition for her outstanding service and support for the Center’s mission, while in 1996 she received the Comité Pro Festival Latinoamericano De Queens - Rigoberta Mechu Award. Chiqui was a self-made woman who earned two Master’s degrees from New York University. The first on Latin American and Caribbean studies (1995), and the second on Global Public Health (2008). After almost 2 decades working at the Institute of International Education's Fulbright Program, Chiqui decided to follow her passion, and focused her attention on underserved immigrants in her community by working as a researcher for various health focused organizations such as Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS, 2008-2010) NYU Langone Cancer Center at Bellevue Hospital (2009-2015), and Americares Foundation (2005-2021) where she aimed at understanding the disparities in access to healthcare by marginalized groups.

He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. In 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. In 2002, he became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica, Queens, and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. “The idea is to use natural elements, such as the sun, wind and greenery on the roof to help insulate the building,” Peter wrote. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the Queens Borough Public Library into the 21st century by installing machines that library patrons could use to check out books on their own. In addition to his work as a city planner and builder, he played an instrumental role in the Towers Coop, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the coop’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to coop status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.', 'year': '2022'}\n",

Fan Noli is venerated by Albanians as a champion of literature, history, theology, diplomacy, journalism, music, and national unity. He played an important role in the consolidation of Albanian as the national language of Albania with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces. He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications, religious texts, and translations. He produced a translation of the New Testament in English, The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece, published in 1961. Noli earned degrees at Harvard (1912), the New England Conservatory of Music (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from Boston University (1945). In 1912, under the leadership of Fan Noli, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America, known as Vatra (The Hearth) was created. Based in Boston, Vatra at the height of its influence had 72 branches throughout the United States. The federation has historically protected the rights of the Albanians in the United States, as well lobbying with the United States Congress about the rights of the Albanians throughout the world.  Today, Vatra Federation continues to be a vibrant home to its many branches across the nation, New York, Michigan, Florida, Massachusetts, and Canada.  Both, Vatra and its newspaper “Dielli” serve as community staple and are based in the Bronx, which is the largest Albanian Community in United States.  Fan Noli was the Chief-editor of the newspaper “Dielli” (The Sun) – which began as a publication of the Boston Albanian society “Besa-Besen” from February 1909, until July 1911. He was ordained a priest at Saint Nicholas Cathedral in New York City in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the League of Nations. Noli’s eloquence in pleading Albania’s cause won him many enthusiastic supporters among the great statesmen of the postwar era, notably President Woodrow Wilson. Largely due to Noli’s impassioned pleas, Wilson fought vigorously for the right of Albania and other small nations to determine their own futures. The London Daily Mail, noting Noli’s great skills in diplomacy, hailed as the ablest of Balkan statesmen and suggested that his colleagues in neighboring countries could learn much from him A memorandum was sent to U. S. President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing a few days before a delegation of Albanian-Americans, led by Fan Noli left for France to take part in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Copies of the memorandum were sent to the foreign ministries of the Allied Powers and their ambassadors in Washington. The aim of the text and of the delegation was to ensure the continued recognition of Albania as a sovereign state. Many of the idealized views expressed in this memorandum, can still be heard among Albanians today. In 1932, Metropolitan Theophan Noli was granted permanent resident status and he returned permanently to the U.S. He had spent eight years in Germany while he waited for this visa. After his return to the U.S.A., he withdrew from political life, and he returned to his duties as the head of the Albanian Orthodox Church in North America. Paralleling his life of service in the Orthodox Church, Noli remained active in politics. An unsurpassed multitalented figure of influence, Fan Noli has been a subject of volumes of publications and research. A Harvard alum and later dual citizen who spent most of his life in the United States, Fan Noli shined in many walks of life: literature, journalism, publications, translations, theology, religious leadership, diplomacy, politics, music and helped shape the foundations of the Albanian nation. Master of 14 languages, a distinguished Shakespearean scholar and translator as well as an accomplished historian.

When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine.

She was an iconic figure at Roberto Clemente Plaza/Kent Village in Williamsburg. As a consummate mental health professional during some of Williamsburg’s most challenging years, she saved hundreds of lives. She helped families and individuals cope with depression, bipolar disorders, and other health issues. When New York State proposed closing the Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in the community where her patients were a priority, she helped lead the campaign to keep the Williamsburg center open, keeping jobs in the local neighborhood. She drew great inspiration in serving as a mentor and role model to young people. She founded a youth marching band that participated in local public events. As a Family Worker at Public School 17, Ms. Torres founded the first majorette group in Williamsburg, the Unidad y Progreso Baton Twirlers (translated as United for Progress Baton Twirlers) later renamed Blossoms. She personally solicited fabric donations from neighborhood merchants and hand-tailored the group’s uniforms to ensure equal participation regardless of ethnicity and socio-economic status. The majorettes achieved acclaim through participation in the Puerto Rican Day and other local parades, and they invited to perform in many surrounding community events. Ms. Torres received donations and gifts of instruments for a youth marching band and later a youth baseball team. The group’s intention was to establish several important goals including pride for and appreciation of cultural heritage which Elisa believed preserved traditions and family values and fostered self-esteem.

The Festival served as an opportunity for community residents to share the cultural heritage of Puerto Rico. In 1984 and under her leadership, Roberto Clemente Cultural Committee, Inc. was established and incorporated a youth baseball and recreation park to serve children ages 6-12. To accomplish this Ms. Torres worked diligently to transform an abandoned lot into a first-class ball field worthy of its namesake, the legendary Roberto Clemente. In 1992, after 20 years of perseverance and hard work, plans for the Roberto Clemente Baseball Field were approved and Ms. Torres worked closely with the Parks department to secure permits and registered the little league with Williamsport Pennsylvania and received the charter, In addition to the baseball field, other programs such as Head Start, after school programs, the Blossoms Majorettes and Marching Drums, Three King’s Day, Heritage Month, Rosario de la Cruz, and Puerto Rico Discovery Day were founded.

He became a member of the Holy Cross Cathedral Orthodox Church and at night pursued a degree in theological studies. He later became a postulant in the Endich Theological Seminary under the tutelage of his Eminence Georg Alexander McGuire. Upon completion of his theological training, he was admitted to the Holy Orders as a Bishop. Bishop Roberts was drawn to organizations that advocated for black self-determination and racial equality and joined the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey\\'s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The first branch of the UNIA in the U.S. was founded in New York in 1917, with the aims of repatriation, promoting racial pride, and the need to develop more independent African states. Bishop Roberts was committed to the spiritual well-being of his Harlem community, which included Caribbean immigrants and African- American migrants from the southern states. Inspired to establish a community-based church, St. Thomas Liberal Catholic Church was established on December 21, 1926 in the village of Harlem. Under the leadership of Bishop James P. Roberts, Sr., the church grew quickly and had to be relocated several times to accommodate its growth. Ultimately, a permanent structure was purchased at 147 West 144th Street in Harlem. Bishop Roberts was truly a spiritual pioneer in Harlem. Today, his son James P. Roberts Jr., serves as the church\\'s bishop. In 1934, Bishop Roberts established The Antigua Progressive Society to provide charitable assistance to his beloved Harlem community and the island of Antigua. The objective was to \"foster friendship, promote and cultivate social, economic, and intellectual intercourse among its members, along with supporters to render aid in time of need, sickness, or death.\" The Society was incorporated in 1935 in New York State with an overarching mission to be \"a beacon of light to all.\" The Antigua Progressive Society later merged with another organization and renamed themselves the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society (ABPS). In 1964, the ABPS purchased a building located at 12 West 122nd Street in the village of Harlem which became its headquarters. That building is fondly referred to as the \"Antigua and Barbuda House.\" ABPS continues to operate from this building eighty-five years after its founding in one of Harlem\\'s Historical districts at 122nd Street and Lenox Avenue. Today, the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society, Inc. is a 50l(c) (3) organization exclusively supporting charitable, religious and educational purposes. In 2012, the society donated the first 50 years of its records to the Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Division at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The following year, a public exhibit at the Schomburg Center titled \"A Lighthouse in New York,\" show cased the records and accomplishments of ABPS. The ABPS continues the legacy of Bishop James P, Roberts, Sr., by actively engaging in the Harlem community. Among the activities, ABPS has adopted the Drew Family Day Care Center in Harlem where our annual \"Holiday Toy Drive\" brings joy to the children and the families of the center. ABPS also supported the Shades of Truth Theater. We have partnered with the local churches such as: Ephesus Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Greater Calvary Baptist Church and the Beulah Wesleyan Methodist Church. We also support women\\'s homeless shelter, organize local book drives for children to promote literacy, serve Thanksgiving Dinner, as well as provide \"take out\" dinners at our headquarters. In our homeland of Antigua & Barbuda, we host an annual blood drive at Mount Saint John Medical Centre in Antigua. The APBS has a strong connection with the local Harlem community and actively helps to foster transnational connections with communities back in Antigua.

This site, however, was already home to roughly 6,000 low-income Melrose residents. Outraged by the injustice of their proposed displacement, the local community banded together to create the We Stay/Nos Quedamos Committee in 1993. This Committee drafted and passed an alternative proposal, the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Plan, resulting in the development of affordable housing for over 4,000 families and seniors and nearly one million square feet of commercial real estate space. NQ was the first nonprofit to successfully utilize the City’s 197a process to create a plan for our own community that preserved all that was valuable to long-time residents. As innovators of the “Melrose Urban Renewal Plan,” NQ has had an unprecedented impact on the positive growth of a region that was once seen as ‘disposable,’ and helped to create a vibrant and diverse community that has become a one-of-a-kind case study of how community power can be transformative. Each year, dozens of urban planners, scholars and community organizations come to NQ to learn about the historical community-led victory that was undertaken. NQ has since served as a leader in community-driven development and provides critical support for Melrose residents, assisting with a variety of economic, social, and environmental issues. NQ’s recent successes include engaging, organizing, and educating tenants around larger issues of affordable housing by helping them form tenant leadership teams; collaborating with artists, arts and culture organizations, and related stakeholders to preserve and amplify the cultural DNA of the South Bronx by creating a comprehensive map of cultural assets in Melrose and Morissania; and working with Melrose community gardens to support the preservation of open space and community resilience.

In 1979, he opened a social club called the “Green House,” to give the people a place to relax. He would offer food, drinks, and entertainment to escape the negative world around them. He started block parties that grew over the years to celebrate the people in the community. He would build a stage out of old doors he collected, and the youth took on leadership roles with organizing the events.

As a result, the Neighborhood Association for Puerto Rican Affairs, Inc. (NAPRA). Carmen became the Executive Director of the Upper Bronx chapter of NAPRA in East Tremont. Soon after, the Upper Bronx NAPRA was awarded a grant for a day care center, known as the Bathgate Day Care Center. In 1979, the Upper Bronx NAPRA was awarded a grant for ‘The Foster Grandparents,’ a national program that is designed for low-income senior centers to volunteer quality time and provide love and assistance to community children with special needs. Carmen’s strength, character, strong moral convictions and leadership of Upper Bronx NAPRA earned her the utmost respect as a role model among her peers, political leaders and government officials. During her lifetime, she touched and inspired so many people. Carmen passed in away in 2007 at the age of 89. To this day, Carmen is still regarded as a pioneer and pillar to the Tremont and Bathgate community.', 'year': '2022'}\n",

Powell Way', 'loc_search': 'At the intersection of Kelly Street and East 163rd Street', 'reason': 'Colin Luther Powell was born on April 5, 1937, and reared in the ethnically mixed Hunts Point section of the South Bronx. His parents, Luther Powell, a shipping-room foreman in Manhattan’s garment district, and Maud Ariel McKoy, a seamstress, were immigrants from Jamaica. Mr. Powell was a pathbreaker, serving as the country’s first Black national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. The young Mr. Powell graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx, before attending City College of New York. An early turning point in Mr. Powell’s life came when he enrolled in the college’s Reserve Officer Training Corps program, drawn by the camaraderie it fostered, the discipline it imposed and its well-defined goals. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, a drill team started by Gen. John J. Pershing, a top American commander in World War I. After graduating from City College in June 1958, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army, serving two decorated combat tours in Vietnam. Mr. Powell rose quickly through the ranks — including gaining a battalion command in Korea in 1973 and a brigade command in the elite 101st Airborne Division in 1976. He was tapped as a “water walker” by his peers, a term military men reserve for the most talented officers. In 1979, Mr. Powell, then 42, was promoted to one-star general, becoming the youngest general officer in the Army at the time. After serving as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger’s senior military assistant, Mr. Powell, in the spring of 1986, went off to command V Corps, skipping division command altogether in leading 75,000 soldiers in West Germany in the waning years of the Cold War. Just five months later, President Reagan summoned him back to Washington to be national security adviser, a post in which he played a pivotal role in helping to usher in a new era of cooperation with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Powell left the White House in 1989 to return to lead the Army’s Forces Command; the promotion made him only the fourth Black four-star general in Army history. He saw himself not only as a model for Black soldiers but also as a challenge to white bigotry. In October 1989, Mr. Powell succeeded Adm. William J. Crowe as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, leapfrogging over 14 more senior four-star officers. Mr. Powell retired from the Joint Chiefs in 1993. He returned to government in December 2000, when he was the first person appointed to the cabinet of President-elect George W. Bush. He left office in January 2005, returning to life as a private citizen. Mr. Powell passed away from complications caused by COVID-19 on Oct. 18, 2021, at the age of 84.', 'year': '2022'}\n",

She subsequently became Queens borough president Donald Manes' director of community boards in 1972 and his deputy in 1980. She took office initially as acting Borough President on February 11, 1986, after Manes resigned. She was elected Borough President by a unanimous vote of the nine New York City Council members from Queens on March 12.

A Borough President’s most influential role in those years was as a member of the Board of Estimate, which — until it was abolished in a municipal reorganization in 1989 — was one of the city’s two top policymaking bodies, along with the City Council. The board, comprising the mayor, the council president, the city comptroller and the five borough presidents, shared with the Council the authority to approve the city’s budget, and it had the final say over matters like zoning and land use. She was noted for her passionate advocacy on issues including economic development, airport disputes, and the environment. For instance, she secured funding for the construction of Queens Hospital Center, as well as for 30,000 more school seats for students. She served as a member of the boards of directors of New York Hospital Queens and St. Mary's Healthcare System for Children. Shulman survived breast cancer.

Facilities include the original site, nine satellites, a mental health facility, twelve school health programs, three part-time facilities, and six administrative/program sites. UHP began in 1974 as an evolution of a group practice with the mission of providing basic and specialty medical care, comparable to those found in local hospital outpatient clinics, to the community’s predominantly Hispanic and poor residents. Originated by Dr. Richard Izquierdo, a life-long resident of the South Bronx and a pediatrician and family practitioner who was concerned by his community’s declining health status, and unable to meet the demand for primary medical services in his private practice, he sought to expand his practice into an HMO-type practice that offered care in a consistent, cost effective, and managed manner. As a result of the lack of primary care services in the area, many residents had grown accustomed to waiting in long lines in local hospital emergency rooms for routine medical care or for the treatment of acute medical conditions, which could have been prevented if diagnosed earlier. Dr. Izquierdo opened the San Juan Health Center in 1967. Seven years later, UHP, a private, non-profit corporation licensed by the Department of Health was established to broaden the scope of the work started by the San Juan Health Center. UHP is designated a NYS Preferred Primary Care Provider, Prenatal Care Assistance Provider, an HIV Primary Care Provider, and a WIC provider. Over the years, UHP has formed alliances with several community-based organizations to provide health care services in alternate delivery sites. These sites consist of local schools, an adult day treatment program, a Boys and Girls Club and homeless shelters.
